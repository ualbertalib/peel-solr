 many good friends in yellow grass sask but it seemed best to make the move i went home for a
 visit while my husband drove from yellow gr ass to calgary with our light dr iving team and buggy he
 interviewed dr james heniman who was then superintendent of home missions for the presbyterian church in alberta and received an
 appointment to strathmore my husband could not wait to see if the appointment was satisfactory as our baby was expected
 very shortly so he sent me word to come to strathmore ‘ i will never forget getting off the train
 one evening and finding that there was neither church nor manse nor congregation at strathmore the big irrigation ditches were
 there and there was the beginning of a town but the place did not i need nor want an ordained
 married minister at that time least of all one in desperate need of a house to live in dr herdman
 was a very old the author violet goldsmith is seen here when man and had no doubt given many years
 of good graduating from the university of new brunswick in 1905 service to the church in his old age he
 had the scotts met me at the train and were most visions of an ordained marned minister in every kind
 to me they put me under the care of dr little town and hamlet in alberta but his vision crawfoni
 and our daughter margaret anna was did not include the fact that each of those born in the general hospital
 on oct 30 1907 ministers would need a house to live in and some my husband came to calgary and
 while i was thing to live on and the church was not in a posi in hospital he hunted around
 for another place tion to supply either so that is how the mistake was made these reminiscences were kindly made

 set out on foot for the homestead we were very comfortable there this was a real in the excitement of
 getting across the river break for us however april 1 soon came around they forgot to take lunch and by
 noon they were and the downeys and their two children freddy very hungry they came to a bachelor shack and
 and mary returned as no one was at home they went in and helped the congregation then rented a house
 for us themselves to what they could find half a loaf in the town at 10 a month that was
 all right of bread and a pot of beans as they were leavfor quite a while till they got behind
 with the ing they met the owner coming home to dinner rent we were told on the side that our
 furniture his name was alan charters in spite of the fact was likely to be seized we did not have
 very that they had eaten his dinner he went with them much but we could not afford to lose what
 we and helped them to find their land it did not had so we took no chances one sunday night
 really matter about the dinner he said as he was we sat around after church till midnight then had leaving
 for crossfield the next morning and some lunch and donned our old clothes and went would get a fresh grubstake
 there to work by daylight we had everything we as they crossed the prairie a bunch of cattle owned off
 the place and on a vacant lot we had came racing past them chased by wild animals 10 having a
 gun and a few cartridges along they come so after causing us several hours delay fired at the wild animals
 and they fled one big she had to be left for the next trip calf had been separated from the
 bunch and had my sister in law and i drove in the buggy with been badly mauled long afterwards they
 heard her baby aileen aged nine weeks our two that the cattle belonged to mr savage and that children margaret
 then two years old and he had said that those wild animals must have hugh aged eight weeks their little
 girl anna been prairie wolves as in his opinion coyotes then six years old came on the load with her
 would not have tackled so large an animal as that father the experience was rather a rough one my husband
 and his brother found the home for her even after having travelled alone all the steads and got back safely
 to mr greentree s way from belfast a few months before it was before dark they decided that the land
 was well no easy task to drive with hugh in my arms worth holding onto as indeed it proved to
 be especially as the horse persisted in trotting down they made a trip with wagons in the spring the hills
 and wandering over the level prairie to of 1909 taking lumber etc and built shacks and eat grass and otherwise
 showing the perversity spent most of the summer there before he left characteristic of a western broncho my husband had
 a session with the home mis after the excitement of getting started and the sion committee in calgary this country
 over delay caused by the dog and the cow we in the the red deer was really an outpost of
 the buggy were glad to stop for a cup of tea and a calgary presbytery at that time the committee
 final gossip with a friend as we went through airat calgary agreed that if he would hold services drie then
 hasten on till we sighted the top of our in the homes of the settlers or wherever he stove pipe
 on the wagon in the distance we thought advisable and report every three months travelled only nine miles that evening
 he would receive a grant according to the work the drive in the hot sun and the excitement done it
 is a wonder they consented to it as the had been too much for margaret and when we presbyterian church
 was down on homestead got out of the buggy she lay prostr ate on the ing ministers the methodist church
 would not ground as we stood helplessly watching her we stand for them at all years afterwards a man were
 thankful to see the rigid form relax and the whose work took him over a large part of alberta tired
 little tr aveller fall into a natur al sleep we told us that he knew of seven ordained pres camped
 for the night in a prosperous district byterian ministers who were living on home known as yankee valley steads and
 carrying on their work of course they the days were very warm and the nights espedid not give full time
 to their work but they cially the early mornings very cold we slept received only a meagre grant they solved
 their in a tent and ate our meals by the roadside many own housing problem which the church was in
 settlers who had long distances to drive fastened no position to do and they brought gospel serv their tents on
 their wagons thus making a shelter ices within the reach of communities that would not otherwise have had them it
 seems to me that for day and night after our noon meal while the horses rested we usually seated our
 selves on in helping hemselves they also helped the the sheltered side of a hill and gave the babies church
 through very difficult times no collec their bath tions were taken up at country points as people did not have
 money to give the second n ight we camped on a hill he third as tom wife and i were
 both expecting that in a valley beside a running stream this was one summer we did not move to the
 homesteads till of the most beautiful spots in the west there fall we left airdrie on aug 31 1909 and
 were hills on all sides and tall trees on the banks arrived on sept 4 having travelled nearly a of
 the stream after making preparations for the hundred miles night we sat enjoying the twilight and the peace the men
 each drove a team of horses pulling fulness of the scene our thoughts wandering a load of household effects on
 one of the loads backward and forward for soon we wer e to cr oss was a box containing our
 twenty hens and a the red deer river turkey and another box held our cat the two we thought of
 the friends we were leaving dogs followed the horses but the smallest one behind and began to realize what it
 meant to go got under the buggy wheels and went limping where the nearest post office was twenty miles back
 to the house we tried to bring the cow but away and where we would be out of all telegraph
 neither persuasion nor force would induce her to communication with the rest of the world 11 so loth we part
 from all we love from all the links that bind us so turn our hearts as on we rove to
 those we ve left behind us on the other hand each day s journey was literally a day s march
 nearer home for were we not going to live in our own houses built on our own land the idea
 of a settled home appealed to me more than to the others as i had been accustomed from infancy to
 the wandering life of a minister s family my father was one of the many who responded to the canadian
 cry for missionaries and came from the isle of man to eastern canada in the late 1870 s while engaged
 in these reflections a typical western prospector joined our group he was a large red faced man somewhat wild in
 appearance and dress he smoked his pipe and entertained us with tales of his adventures till twilight faded into darkness
 the fourth night we spent in a vacant shack some of the country was very dreary and some most picturesque
 next day we crossed the red deer river on a ferry when half way over the horses concluded that they
 could make better time than the ferry and only the prompt action of the men on board prevented them from
 plunging into the water until a short time before all who crossed the river had had to ford it the
 first party violet goldsmith and john brossn ‘ iere photographed at who came to it did not know its depth
 so they the time of their marriage in 1906 got the tallest man to wade across then the others overturned
 by the force of the water after strugfollowed with their teams gling for some time they got on top of
 the buggy the banks of the river are regular mountains and finally were rescued by some passers by with coal
 in abundance sticking out of the sides near the end of the journey one of our loads it took the
 four horses to bring each load up and upset and stoves bedding trunks etc went he wheels of the wagons
 had to be chained going tumbling over the prairie this delayed us half down the hill on one side had
 been graded a a day few weeks before it would almost make one when within four miles of our destination
 we dizzy to look down to the place where loads had were overtaken by darkness and had the difficult been
 hauled before the grading was done task of finding our way over the prairie as best we forded a winding
 creek seven times and we could with little to guide us when almost each time there was a steep bank
 to go down and there the buggy broke down and we had to finish up we never knew whether the
 horse would the journey on foot we were most thankful to come down on his feet or we on our
 heads in reach the end of it to grope our way into our the water often my sister in law
 would wade it own shack make ourselves a cup of tea and lie with her baby under one arm and
 mine under the down to rest other while i put margaret down at my feet and for the first winter
 we brought in our groceries drove on sometimes margaret and i waded too from calgary soon the sylvester family started
 leaving the horse and buggy for one of the men a small store in one room of the house they
 had to bring across built they hauled their merchandise from cross on a previous trip my husband s load stuck
 field and later from acme with team and wagon on a rock in the creek and he had to jump
 in at one time when we were out of money they though there was ice on the water in order
 to gave us the necessities on credit for which we extricate it another party who crossed in the were most
 grateful we got flour r olled oats tea spring when the water was high had the buggy and sugar as
 other things ran out we just did 12 without them finally a small cheque came found that by mashing the
 berries with a bottle through from the home mission board and we first then cooking them a short time they
 made were able to pay our debt and go on good jam and could be mixed with other fruit for
 of course we had our own milk butter eggs variety the jam required fewer sealers and made and sometimes meat
 and vegetables one whole excellent pies we never tired of saskatoons and summer our only meat was home cured bacon
 many a year they were the only fruit we had it became very monotonous one year when we we got
 our coal from a surface mine part way had no luck with our vegetables my husband down the clarke hill
 the men would take lunch made a trip to near stettler and bought potatoes and dig for most of a
 day and come home with and vegetables from a farmer there we also got a nice jag of fairly good
 coal further east of us some lovely heads of cabbage but they did not some neighbours dug an underground mine
 they keep too well in our cellar which was just a hole had not used it long till a young
 man of the disin the ground under the shack in a later year trict peter sylvester was killed when a
 piece a carload of vegetables was sent to our com of rock or coal fell on him munity from some
 district near edmonton when the wild animals in our district were the we had a failure and they had plenty
 coyote rabbit badger skunk porcupine weasel we used rabbits for food in the early years and gopher on r are
 occasions deer and antelope a roasted rabbit with dressing in it made a were seen and very rarely wolves were
 heard delicious meal i made hamburger of one rabbit skunks weasels and badgers killed chickens a and had it fried
 when the children came home skunk got into our henhouse and killed and from school they said who s been
 to town mangled thirteen old hens he was still there today they knew there was no meat in the when
 we went out and we killed him coyotes house it was good and we had a fine meal in came
 into farm yards and ran off with chickens later years most of the rabbits were diseased and turkeys they had
 water blisters on them and were unfit soon after we had settled on our homestead for food i cooked one
 and it smelled so good my husband was out over the hill to the west but when i cut it
 i found the blisters and we had when he saw that someone had driven onto our to throw it out
 we were a disappointed family pre emption with a load of lumber and was startthat day we soon gave up
 using them ing to build a shack he went over the next day occasionally we had a good dinner of
 wild to have a talk with the man he was tom mckee duck a day s fishing at the red
 deer sometimes an irishman like himself a bachelor and his resulted in a meal of fresh fish mostly gold eyes
 papers were in order it was his homestead our later on we used to send away for as much as
 papers were in order too and it was our prea hundred pounds of frozen fish for the winter emption i
 don t remember whose papers had the mostly whitefish salmon trout and pickerel earlier date the mistake was made in
 the sometimes a neighbour would make a trip to calgary land office so they decided to go in cold lake
 and bring back a load of fish and together and have it made right they made the peddle them amongst
 the community once a trip to calgary with his horses and our buggy beef ring was started and it lasted
 for a year or many months passed before it was finally settwo there was difficulty in keeping a quantity tled
 the quarter section north of us had been of beef for any length of time so the ring was filed
 on by an elderly german he had come out of benefit to everyone in the fall and started to m
 ike a dug out in the most of the early years there was a good crop side of a hill
 intending to live in it then he of saskatoons along the red deer river and at decided to go out
 for the winter and return in the the hand hills some years a late spring frost spring but he died
 before then all his relatives killed the blossoms and some years they were lived in germany and the authorities had
 to comhailed many a summer day we took lunch to the municate with them river picked saskatoons till late in
 the afternoon none of them wanted to take on the homebathed in the river and got home in time for
 the stead so it went back to the government my evening chores we cooked the berries with husband then signed
 away his right to the other sliced lemons when we could get them vinegar quarter on condition that he would
 be given that or rhubarb to take away the flat taste we tried quarter as his pre emption so that
 is how it was boiling them a long time to make jam but that settled this quarter was on the
 same side of the just made them hard and shrunken later we road allowance as our homestead and the land
 13 was just as good so we were quite satisfied and they brought some machinery with them from so glad
 that it was settled peaceably to the the united states they had only two sections satisfaction of all concerned a
 great deal of ill of harrows and used them for several years till feeling might have resulted if they had
 not they had considerable acreage broken they worked together agin the government brought seed oats but when they saw the
 oats for while tom mckee was batching mr and sale in stettler they bought some they had mrs robert gibson
 came from the united states never seen such fine oats in the states to visit him mrs gibson was his
 sister and had they also had their share of hardships mrs been married only a short time one day the
 two rodseth told me they were without potatoes their men were out shooting and tom raised his gun first winter
 of 1910 11 from new year s on to fire at a prairie chicken but the gun acci before that
 they had two sacks that they had dentally discharged and shot mr gibson we brought from stettler potatoes could not
 be were in the garden and saw tom come over the hauled far after winter set in as they would
 hill waving his arms and shouting for someone freeze they had plenty of beef bought from to come my husband
 went over at once and mcconnells but no potatoes when he saw what had happened he drove to their neighbours
 the sylvesters had moved drumheller in a hurry for the doctor but mr in from crossfield where they had been
 farming gibson died before the doctor arrived the they had ever ything to farm with machinery tr agedy cast a
 deep gloom over the community hor ses cattle and poultry mrs sylvester a very we gave evidence at the inquest
 in drumheller kind hearted woman gave each of her three and the verdict was accidental death nearest neighbours mrs rodseth
 mr s steward many pioneer families of the area moved in and mrs morley a hen from her flock of
 about the same time we did i will mention just chickens to start them up a few of them john
 ewing came in with a small threshing in 1910 the rodseths came to the district via machine run by four
 horses they drove it around stettler as they could not depend on getting in a circle he threshed for himself
 and the near across the red deer river at any nearer place neighbour s the murray family had the first
 large mrs rodseth and her three small children stayed outfit run by steam then mr colter got one in stettler
 for three weeks while her husband and i think it was run by gasoline each farmer who her brother mr
 idsvik hauled two loads mostly wished to be threshed put a man and team and lumber to the homestead and
 built a shack the bundle rack on the outfit if possible usually the turtlebacks were so bad that one of
 the horses farmer drove his team himself we stacked all went lame and one load had to be left on
 the of the first crops as we never knew how long it way when mr rodseth returned to stettler he
 would be before a threshing machine came had a borrowed hor se to put to the buggy to take around
 later just the green feed was stacked the family to the homestead as night was com and the rest of
 the crop stook threshed that was ing on they came to a large house and asked if before there were
 combines they could stay for the night the woman of the after we had a few acres broken we still
 had house refused them lodging it was snowing no seeder i drove the wagon up and down the heavily at
 the time so they went on until they field margaret and hugh asleep at my feet while came to a
 sod shack the woman there was most my husband broadcast the seed from the back hospitable she said if they
 could put up with he harrowed it walking behind the harrows i what she had they were very welcome so
 they don t remember whether it was wheat or oats spread their bedding on the floor and were most but
 it grew there was a cold rain and sleet fallgrateful for shelter for the night mrs rodseth ing part of
 the time while we were seeding said she learned a lesson in hospitality that she the only roads in the
 country were wagon never forgot and she never refused food or trails so most of my husband s travelling was
 shelter to anyone in need of it done on horseback he would leave for a morn as they continued their
 journey they had to ing service at livingstone i would do the noon ford a creek as it was spring
 the water was high chores get the children ready and we would set and the bottom of the creek was
 soft the horse out on foot after lunch for bixbys it was 1 ½ sank and could not pull the
 buggy out the men miles by the road but we went across the prairie had to wade in and unhitch
 the horse lead him a shorter distance but very rough walking out then pull the buggy out themselves margaret could
 walk both ways but hugh was 14 the brown farm was part of a well established area when photographed in
 1956 however the original homestead shack may still be seen at the extreme left just learning to walk and had
 to be carried most later on he moved to drumheller and joined the of the way i tried putting him
 on my back and salvation army he was their standard bearer for holding his arms but that tired him so
 i put him years in his later years he was cared for in one in a flour sack and held
 it by the corners i would of their homes till his death turn him loose and let him walk a
 while then we were most fortunate to find ourselves in put him in the sack again when we got there
 a community of church going people they came i conducted the sunday school and my husband to sunday school as
 families and stayed to came later and held the service i rode the horse church it did not matter what
 their nationality home with hugh in the saddle in front of me was or what denomination they belonged to while
 my husband walked and led the horse besides presbyterians and methodists we had once when the rev william shearer was
 anglicans and lutherans baptists and seventh superintendent of missions he came to our day adventists etc some people had religious
 place it was on a summer evening and he had ideas of their own been driving his horse and buggy
 all day in the sunday school at livingstone was never so hot sun he was ver y weary and was
 glad of a large as at verdant valley in the cassel hill good night s sleep on a shakedown on
 our kitchen district the service was held in the wilson and floor which was the only accommodation we eraut homes
 before the school was built it was could give him the next day he was quite discontinued later and the
 church goers of that refreshed he was a good friend to us and under district attended livingstone or verdant valley
 stood the difficulties we were up against a coal mine was opened up at what is now verdant valley school
 was built in 1912 and rosedale it was then known as moodie s mine from then on it was used
 for church and sunday named for frank moodie who started it an eveschool the women s institute was organized ning
 service was held there sometimes in the that year and its first project was to provide an dining room and
 sometimes in one of the bunk organ for the school there was a good sunday houses the miners would cheerfully
 clear out school there for many years the bunkhouse and make it ready for the service the first superintendent was
 duncan then put things back afterwards one winter the mcdonald an elderly bachelor who came from services were particularly good
 there were new brunswick he had not much formal educa many good musicians and they prepared a fine tion but
 was such an eloquent public speaker that musical program for each service mrs cecil he was known as flowery mac
 it was a fulton the merchant s wife played the organ natural talent and he made good use of it
 when there were three violins and the singing was 15 something to remember that winter there were lovingly cared for
 by the family many farmers from the surrounding country in 1919 our neighbour tom mckee made a working in the
 mine as there had been a crop trip to ireland leaving a young austrian named failure otto in charge of
 his farm our children always on one appointment where my husband had called him two chances to one because he
 to stay overnight he got body lice as soon as used that expression in almost every sentence he came home
 on monday morning he changed sometimes more than once he often visited us underwear and the one with the cooties
 was and i think of him with the deepest gratitude put outside till we could get boiling water to scald
 that was the winter of the second flu epidemic it it happened to be new woolen underwear too and all
 seven of us had it at once i was the last when the town of munson started my husband to
 go down i had been waiting on the others and held a sunday service there for some time doing the
 chores when i had to give up we got munson had been fox coulee at first there was two chances
 to one to come over and milk a good congregation and they soon started to the cow and do the
 other outside chores each day build a church by an arrangement between the i don t know what we would
 have done without methodist and presbyterian churches munson him most of the neighbour s were sick too and was given
 over to the methodists had their own troubles when drumheller started up a little later on one day before i
 took sick my husband sudthe first service was held in a restaurant owned denly got out of bed and was
 determined to go by sid skuce and run by mrs boyd later it was outside he was tired staying in
 the house and held in an upstairs hall still later it was held in was going out for a walk
 i stood between him the first church which was also used as a school and the door and watched him
 trying to get my husband continued to preach at the country dressed he soon played out and was glad to
 be schools for some time then one spring he was helped back to bed he did not attempt to get
 kicked on the ankle by a cow and was laid up up for a whole week and when he recovered
 he for three months it was plain that he would not had no recollection of the incident i am sure
 he be able to continue preaching any longer so a was so sick he did not know what he was
 doing student was placed in the field for some years if he had gone out that day it is very
 unlikely the country points were supplied by student mis that he would have recovered as we heard of sionaries later
 on the minister from delia many people who went outside came in and went preached at verdant valley and the
 minister from to bed a nd never got up again it seems wonderful drumheller at livingstone this was a very
 that all seven of us got over it with no doctor or satisfactory arrangement nurse to take care of us
 in 1916 kathleen steward came to our neigh we had been fortunate to escape the first flu bourhood she had
 been born and raised in the year before it was worse but the second was england and had gone to
 china with a wealthy bad enough my husband conducted the funeral english family as a practical nurse after several of
 percy mckee who died of the first flu when years there they were returning to england they were leaving the
 cemetery in drumheller through canada when she stopped off to visit her they met another funeral procession coming in brother
 walter steward once here she decided with no one to conduct the service they asked to stay many an early
 settler was grateful for my husband to do it and he did i have been told her kindly assistance in
 cases of illness when that during the epidemic the undertaker s wife gina rodseth had pneumonia at the age of
 five mrs humphries read the burial service for a and was not expected to recover miss steward member of a
 family who had just come to drumrubbed a little brandy under her nostrils with her heller they spoke very little
 english and had no finger and when the doctor a young man from church connection as yet but they wanted
 a delia arrived he said that it had saved her life christian burial for their loved one and they were
 miss steward married mr emmerson she most grateful for what she had done for them later died of the flu
 leaving a baby daughter her there were many near tragedies in those days sister in law also died of the
 flu leaving six some of them in our own family one day my children later her sister miss ethel parmenter
 husband tried to ford the river down by caldcame from england and lived with the family till wells he had
 forded it at the same place the year the children were all grown up and married she before on a
 trip to gleichen and he did not know was a cripple for years before her death and was that these
 fords do not always stay in the same 16 i suppose we never would have got the mortgage paid if
 there had not been a war which is not a pleasant thought then there was the ever present danger of
 fii it was many years before we had a brick ‘ t i chimney at first the stove pipe went
 straight up through the roof and the distance between the stove and the roof was far too short one hot
 summer day i decided to do my washing out behind the shack in the shade i was alone with the
 two children margaret and hugh i made a wood fire in the stove to heat the water and was washing
 away when i heard a crackling noise i thought it was just the wood burning in the stove r till
 i looked up and saw flames coming out under the roof fortunately there was a bucket of water in the
 kitchen a nd a barrel of water on the wagon beside the shack i had to get up on a
 chair each i time i filled the bucket i used the wash basin to throw the water up to the
 roof and finally got the fire out i never could have done it only for the way we had the
 wall finished we had stretched burlap across the 2 x 4 s and then gone over it with paste this
 was draught proof and kept the shack warm the fire just smouldered the twins bertha and art in front posed
 with their in it and died so i was able to confine my attencousin elizabeth brown and their pets about
 1924 tion to the burning boards when it was out i place he got into deep water and the horses
 went up on the roof to make sure ther e was no started to swim the wagon box floated off
 the fire still in the shingles i put the washboard running gear and he was out in the water for
 across the tub to get up but as i got off it the tunately in early life he had learned
 to swim but tub upset and the clothes went onto the ground was out of practice and being fully clothed
 with not on grass but on dirt that had been thrown up great difficulty he managed to swim a few
 yards when the cellar was dug it was a real mess but till his feet touched bottom and he was
 able to hat seemed a trifle when we had so nearly lost walk to shore the horses reached the other
 side our shack but one of them became entangled in the harness there was no way for me to get
 down but to and was drowned two of our neighbours herb jump it is said that anything that you have
 ever morrow and alan charters were down to the learned you will find use for at some time in river
 for coal that day and they brought my hus your life in the west i remembered that back band home
 they called in at andrew clarke s at normal school in fredencton we were taught shack and borrowed some dry
 clothing and a fur a swedish system of gymnastics one exercise coat it was summer but after such a soaking
 he was to jump and land with our knees bent as i needed the warmth stood there on the roof
 i imagined i could hear the loss of the horse was a serious blow to the teacher say prepare to
 jump jump and us we had no money to buy another so my hus i did it as i was
 taught and suffered no ill effects band and his brother tom made a trip to calgary when all was over
 the place was in a terrible to make arrangements for a loan we had friends mess and i was completely
 exhausted in there who were willing to back a note at the after that we fixed the stove pipe differently
 bank so that tided us over for the time being my husband had seen one like it somewhere but that
 was the beginning of our experience with i have never seen one like it before or since we debt and
 it lasted till very recent years the debt got two t s and four elbows it was made into increased
 largely through having a well drilled a doughnut shaped pipe inserted before the stove and when the bank would no
 longer carry the pipe reached the roof it kept more heat in the note we had to mortgage the farm
 to pay it off house and was much safer 17 it never occurred to us that pipes arranged in panties
 mama maked them and put elastic in this way would need to be cleaned much oftener them than a straight
 pipe and that led to another near when bill needed a pair of overalls for school tragedy one morning towards
 spring we were we made them out of the good parts of an old all sick when we woke up
 there had been a blow binder canvas and dyed them brown there was down in the night and we slowly
 realized that almost endless wear in them and they looked we were gassed we dressed and went outside quite passable
 the other boys wanted to know while we aired the house and were soon feeling what they were made of
 they discovered some better that day we took the pipes down and of the small holes where the canvas had
 been cleaned them they were simply stuffed with tacked to the slats and the secret was out soot and the
 wonder is that we had been able arthur had a good strong school shirt about the to get the fire
 to burn at all the pipes were colour of coffee finally his elbows wore cleaned often from then on through
 and i had nothing suitable to patch it with the sleeves soon were past mending and during the depression ba
 les of clothing were the rest of the shirt was still sound then i had sent to us by the
 church i had the pleasure of a bright idea i took a fifty pound salt sack and unpacking and distributing
 it in a large family boiled it in strong thick tea until it was close to one of the boys
 had been wearing his mother s the right colour i used this to make half sleeves buttoned boots to school
 she wore them to and cuffs and it lasted for months till the crop church on sunday he certainly was
 glad to have came off a pair of boy s boots of his own from the bundle handkerchiefs were made
 of empty ten cent this clothing was greatly appreciated and filled salt sacks neatly hemmed shoe laces were a real
 need i used a piece of blue serge that came strong string soaked in ink with the ends waxed in
 one of the bales to make a pair of pants for empty flour sacks were the standby they were my
 oldest boy hugh who was about four years made into sheets pillow cases mattress covers old at the time the
 first time he wore them to tea towels and undergarments of all kinds we sunday school when the primary class
 assem could not have gotten along without them any bled for the lesson he stepped out in front of the
 better than the men could have managed without class and said to the teacher see my new haywire sad death
 of an englishman few will have heard without feelings of the deepest regret of the sad death of a young
 englishman named f yate lee he was a friend of mr crawley ricardo on whose ranch on the bow river
 he has been occupied since his arrival here only two weeks ago he was engaged herding horses and it was
 his custom to bring them into the ranch at halfpast six friday night however he did not return at the
 usual hour and about 7 o clock mr ricardo went out to look for him and found the poor young
 fellow lying dead about a mile from the ranch a rope was fixed firmly around one of his hands the
 rope which was about twenty feet long being around his horse s neck poor young lee had evidently been dragged
 some distance as his shirt was torn completely off his chest while his face and knees were much cut about
 mr ricardo brought the body into town and took it to the barracks although comparatively a stranger to most yet
 those who knew mr lee who was only about 20 years of age speak of him as being a bright
 promising young fellow and the sad death of the poor boy has made a deep impression in town an inquest
 will be held at the barracks at 2 p m calgary tribune june 26 1899 18 discovery of the cave

 this historic decision to go back to the tree ladder and call to them to were recalled by william mccardell
 in his auto come down and see one of the grandest sights biography written about 1938 when he was in
 they would ever witness in their lives his eighties the portions quoted here 2 begin before getting them down i
 thought i might when he had left his companions and descended go up myself into the golden sunlight above i
 on a tree trunk into the cave by the only shouted that i wanted to come up and so i
 entrance a hole in the roof fastened the rope around my waist r eady for the ascent i shouted that
 i had reached the bottom all in a very few seconds i was safely landed at right and that as
 soon as i had accustomed my the top where all sorts of questions were hurled sight to the darkness of
 the cavern i would call at me as to what it looked like down there in those to them at
 the top this was the grandest sensa eerie depths tion i had ever experienced in all my life taking don
 t ask any questions i replied just the candle and matches from my pocket i struck strip off your spare
 clothing and climb down a light and again the flame affected my sight tom was eager and ready to go
 down but leaning up against the tree it was not very he landed at the bottom in a short time
 and long until i could pretty well see but could not true to his flare for giving a fillip to
 any new see very far adventure called up to us landed in a new i scrambled around the edge of
 the water and world i began now to witness one of the grandest spec and that expressed it as well
 as anything could tacles which i believed very few men had ever soon i was down with tom to share
 with him beheld beautiful stalactites hung in great clusters the splendour of the cave from the roof of the great
 amphitheatre like it s so beautiful said tom in hushed tones cavern when i shouted up to tom and frank
 that i don t find words to give expression to it seemed as though i was speaking out of an
 my enthusiastic surprise it is a great sight and immense drum the sound rumbling and echo somewhat of an adventure
 to come down into this ing in an eerie way but the beautiful glistening wonderful and unknown unexplored secret stalactites
 that decorated this silent cave were like hidden world gleaming with treasures of old some fantastic dream from a tale
 of the arabian mother nature nights glittering crystals and stalactites i remarked to tom isn t that a great crystal
 bedecked that dome like cavern they had pool of water which nature formed before the era attained such perfection that
 it must have when she was slowly forming the stalactites it required myriads of years to shape them to the
 is clear as crystal and just the right temperature size they had developed to too in my temporary imprisonment i
 fell to musing what a place it would be to have a nice good in the unearthly beauty of this
 cave i was pleased swim i added as an afterthought that i had the good fortune to be selected as
 the tom was immediately enthusiastic what do one to go down into this unknown and unheard you say billy if
 we have a good plunge in this of cavern that was destined to become famous glor ious sulphur pool throughout
 the world and a mecca for travellers it was so hot in the cave that we had to take little
 did i think at this time that prominent off most of our clothes in order to be able to stop
 men from every part of the world would some down in the cave at all day visit this famous cave
 and be delighted and here goes said tom as he stripped off first invigorated with its healing and curative waters
 and the first human being had broken the sur i was recalled to the realities of the moment by face
 of those clear pellucid waters within a realizing that my continued silence in contem minute i was with him how
 gloriously warm plating the beauty of the cave might be mis this water and the pool had just the right
 depth construed by those above as indicating hat some to swim in thing might have gone wrong with the exploring
 i had reached a point on the floor of the cave the manuscript goes on to describe the buildwhere i
 could see where the water from the dark ing of a shack viewing platform and railings at bubbling poo 1
 escaped out to the bench below the cave and basin sites it also tells of the men ‘ s 20
 fii rther exploration of the area dreaming offor we jealously guarded our rights to the sulphur tunes to be made
 once the hot springs became springs to the extent that some of us stayed known the trio submitted a land
 claim to ottawa around that vicinity continuously while others hunted and foraged the district there was no post office by
 which we might mail any letters to ottawa by way of making a tom mccardell stayed at the shack protectreport
 of our discovery but as there were ing their interests while frank mccabe and engineers and their staff going down
 to padmore william mccardell attempted to raise money to we used this means of communication at this develop the area
 after following the rogers point was a sort of supply depot for the engineer engineering party through kicking horse pass
 ing parties under mr rodgers we sent a letter william mccardell stayed to work on railway on with them which
 they assured us they would construction while mccabe returned to canmore post out from padmore we also went over to
 as a cpr foreman they were to pool their earnour friend riley and had him forward a letter to ings
 and use them to construct new buildings by ottawa in this we had written asking to be per the cave
 and basin hot springs trouble mitted to homestead the land around the springs developed before their ambitious plans could be
 we were informed that there were no home carried out steading rights in the mountains we again wrote to ottawa
 asking for the right to stake the springs one morning in early june i received a as a miner al
 claim but we were informed this telegr am from tom mccardell which read could not be classified as mineral property
 come at once important business concern we asked ottawa if our rights as discoverers ing springs would be acknowledged but
 in most of their i lost no time in starting for banff i boarded letters they were quite evasive and
 very indefinite a construction train at donald and was travelling in their reply if they replied at all eastward as
 fast as steam would carry me when i ‘ this shack built b illiam and tom mc ardell and frank
 mccabe shortly after they discovered the hot springs in 1883 served as the first tourist facility at the site 21
 i reached banff mccabe was no where to be found but one d g woodworth sic appeared on the scene
 woodsworth was an eminent lawyer and m p from nova scotia and he inveigled mccabe to assign his right to
 the banff springs using as he did my name in the document which would have left woodsworth and myself complete
 owner s of the springs frank mccabe since i had left him contracted a very unsatisfactory matrimonial engagement out of
 which he was very anxious to unravel him self and so sold his rights using my name unknown to me
 this was the error that he and woodsworth made in the bargain which strictly 4 fl speaking was made on
 a false premise mccabe could not be found anywhere and no information as to his whereabouts could be had from
 his nova scotia confidant there was no doubt that even if he had any information in this respect he would
 not transmit it in any case and so to james lougheed a rising and clever young lawyer i turned for
 assistance in this embroglio the honourable thomas white minister of the interior was on his way west and was stopping
 off at regina the astute d b woodsworth had left here in order to meet the honourable thomas white at
 that place and sub william lccardle mit the document to the minister and take up we had attended to immediate
 things woodswith him the question of recognition of his rights worth was headed off the question now was by way
 of purchase from the owners james how to find mccabe who was hiding in some lougheed very rightly told me
 that there was only place or another in the town of calgar y at this one remedy whereby we could
 head woodsworth time however the community would hardly be off and that was to send a protest by telegram called
 a town jack ingram was first chief of to the minister police in calgary then and we decided that the
 lougheed told me that the telegram must whole story must be told to him so hat we could embrace and
 cover the entire procedure since i put on him the task of locating mccabe and trace left mccabe in the
 summer of 1884 up to the him if possible a warrant for mccabe s arrest present time he put down
 the requisite protest was sworn out before jack could legally carry abbreviating as much as possible this telegram out this
 duty which cost 22 00 but it had effective results he was well acquainted with hugh mcleod for when white
 presented this telegram to and his grand central hotel a letter could be woodsworth he was highly indignant he dropped
 into a box into which messages were left claimed that he had not taken advantage of my by old friends
 and acquaintances since hugh absence when signing and that he had not been kept a well regulated house for ranchers
 and false in any of his actions that mccabe had every cowboys and this method of communication was right to
 sign my name without my knowing it frequently resorted to many other types of according to the understanding of that
 question persons frequented this place they were not a able document executed in my absence woods large group and to
 some extent this hostely was wort h was to pay mccabe 1 500 for our right a central point the
 residents of this hotel to the springs the fact was embodied in the generally took a look through the letters
 in the telegram that woodsworth had not paid mccabe letter box this being open to the public at any one
 single cent he had however told mr time among he letters i noticed one with frank white that he had
 put up the specified money as mccabe s handwriting and addressed to mr per the bargain made and entered into
 between d b woodsworth m p this i knew would himself and mccabe reveal the entire enigma relative to the
 mccabe 22 mystery and so i immediately informed our when the police chief and myself entered his friend and chief
 of police jack ingram of the hideout and ingram presented and read the warevidence unearthed in the grand central hotel
 rant to mccabe he almost collapsed in terror jack hurriedly came over to the hotel and when and at once
 sat down on a rudely constructed i pointed out the letter to him he at once grabbed bench close to
 the hideout door he piteously it and tore it open begged not to be led away and seeing my name
 i would not dare do that when i first dis on the warrant mccabe entreated me fervently covered the letter
 i told jack at this juncture and invoked the memory of our previous friendly no said jack it is better
 that you didn t associations and asked what could be done to as you had no right to do so
 but in my case i condone for any violation or breach of good faith have the right aslaminsearthofafugitivefrom you have
 no idea how i regret my actions the law and am empowered to act as i am now of the
 recent past mccabe told me doing i replied to him in anything but a pleasant when jack read the letter
 he handed it to me voice your friend woodsworth has gone to to read it said regina to meet the
 honourable thomas white for god s sake come at once and pay me some to lay before him the sale
 of yours and my rights money the money you agreed to as i am anxious to the banif springs and
 it appears that he treated to leave the country and i am suffering the tortures you like a boy or
 a real simpleton and didn t of hell in waiting here pay you a ‘ damned cent on account bride

 ended and the land seeker started out he looked back up the road but could see no sign of the
