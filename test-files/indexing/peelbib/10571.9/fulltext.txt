 2 with this issue our readers will find a change in the style and title of their paper what started 
 as a purely esquimalt effort the result of an idea shared by a couple of people is growing into a 
 record of the daily doings and thoughts of the members of princess patricia s canadian light infantry from the head 
 of the great lakes to the pacific coast it has been realized that our old title was not fully in 
 accord with the widening scope of the publication and it is the fond hope of the staff that the amended 
 name will find approval from those whose activities are our concern jf fc jf it was found impossible to publish 
 the patrician during the late spring and summer what v ith spring training camp schools machine gun concentrations route marches 
 weddings and open hours in the garrison canteen all the devotion of the staff availed naught in the way of 
 publication however all things do happen in their appointed time and even now this edition of our paper is humbly 
 offered for the enjoyment 0:enjoy 0:ment and edification of such as may deign to read the same from time to 
 time in these columns we have called the attention of all good loyal and faithful friends to the sad fact 
 that we are not circulating our magazine to nearly enough ex members of the regiment one of the aims and 
 ambitions of this paper is to keep former patricia s in touch with the regiment and to this end we 
 again beg and beseech every one of our readers to put their copy in the way of all the old 
 comrades whom they can waylay and get them enrolled in the list of subscribers f c s e 
 3 the congratulations of all ranks go to pte robins c l a of b company on winning the king 
 s medal at the dominion of canada rifle association meeting at ottawa this year it is a feat of which 
 we are all proud we hope that he may follow it up in the best manner for may years to 
 comei with real regret we say good bye to lieut colonel h w riven dso mc who relinquishes command of 
 the regiment shortly and retires to pension we have included in this issue a very short survey of his service 
 ith the regiment which to many of our older comrades will recall other and busier days colonel riven s going 
 takes from us another of the now very few originals who have stayed in the service and severs another link 
 with the formation of the regiment and it s earliest history it is the sincere wish of all ranks that 
 colonel riven may find the leisure and the opportunity to pay many nd frequent visits to his old commmd his 
 going leaves but five of the original members of the regiment still serving they are major w g colquhoun mc

 original colour waved in the front line all day and wss bespattered with shrapnel and bullets it waved to encourage 
 the regiment to the greatest deeds and to the greatest sacrifices time after time the flower of the prussian infantry 
 attacked our position and time after time they ere driven back and when only one hundred and fifty wore left 
 of the seven hundred that fought side by side in the morning your colour was still waving over our position

 conducted by lieut coristine and cpl linsley came to an end early in may and l cpl polinsky was selected 
 to at end the course at r m c during the summer unfortunately cpl polinsky developed some awful malady which 
 stiffened him up like a broken down old sport and was unable to finish the course it was very hard 
 luck and are all sympathize with him incidentally one hears that cpl mack of a coy w s the star 
 turn on the abovementioned 0:above 0:mentioned course congratulations the signallers had their little time of times also in may when 
 thirteen of them classified and some five others have made the first steps along the lines to extra pay among 
 the changes wrought in our signal section are the appointments of sergeant quinn and coreoral loveless as signalling sergeant arid 
 signalling corporal respectively several of our old signallers have been promoted out of this sactio ah well just one of 
 the perils of seniority the machine gunners are the proud possessors of some new transport to wit one truck ford 
 ys 2 ton m g s for the use of their antios as they dash around inventing and perfecting 0:per 
 0:fecting a drill for use with the new vehicle are still a natter of awe and wonderment for the rest 
 of the company two of their number l cpl hell and pte roberts 3 0 attended a course in o 
 l m g carrier work at sarcee this summer and earned their certificates aloa g with several pleasant comments 0:com 
 0:ments from their instructors as we go to press rumours are rife of an increase in our m t time 
 marches on tactical training came into its own early in tlie season whan both macauley and gorge vale golf ooursas 
 wore the scene of heroic battles as the company prepared itself for greater thiaxgs at heal s camp there on 
 june 25th they captured with great elan an enemy oosiaiou in depth in the vicinity 0 the butts true 5 
 platoon shed af ar tears a s they supplied supporting fire but the sight of 6 platoon dashing into the 
 assault wearing so 10 hideous sort of masks that quite frightened 0:fright 0:ened all the enemyaway was a thrilling spectacle 
 meanwhile the machine gunners made a lot of noise in rear and mortar bombs exploded with deadly effect ell of 
 which gave a most realistic touch to the battle soma civilians wire appeared oa the scene were quite co winced 
 of the seriousness of the ocas si on j the only casualty was the water pie eat the 300 j 
 r d 
 14 firing point which suddenly developed geyser tendencies thereby offering a new reference point for fire orders on 19th april 
 lieut j r c sutherland returned fron england and other points of interest according to his account these courses abroad 
 must indeed be all embracing those of us who remained like the women of troy at home are secretly quite 
 jealous of him hut of course we would never tell him thati unable to stay put in one place very 
 long mr sutherland left us for some five weeks in july and august to spend a pleasant time at sarcee 
 camp where he expounded at some length on the subject of machine guns back for the machine gun concentration camp 
 at heals where he distinguished himself 0:him 0:self as an inventor more of that later and without pausing he is 
 off again this time to medicine hat alta to conduct a provisional school for the south alberta regiment lieut p 
 3 coristine left us on 20th august en route to courses in england but found himself too early for the 
 abovementioned 0:above 0:mentioned so became attached to the royal canadian regiment at st jean que on the 5 h september 
 where one hears he has made quite an imor ess ion he sailed for england early in october the good 
 wishes of all ranks go with him at long last the results of last series s royal school came to 
 light ana the following members of 3 company found themselves qualified as under pte hatch d l q sergeant m 
 c henry h j a h q sergeant img patterson h q robins c l a q 11 snow a 
 l j q corporal on 25th april c q h s c f lawrence was married at the uaval and 
 military garrison church esquiraalt to miss marie pye of victoria tv ere was a largo turnout for the wedding which 
 was one of the events of the spring season here following 0:follow 0:ing a reception at the home of the 
 bride s uncle the couple left for a honeymoon in california they nave made their bona in esquimaltg 
 15 sargeant instr falconer renewed his connection with the signal corps when on 30th march he left to conduct a 
 school of visual telegraaphy at salmon arm and vernon the results one hears were very satisfactory it seens that sergeant 
 instr falconer made a hit up in these parts for he is at present away in the same stamping grounds 
 this time on a provisional school of infantry ceremonial has played quite a part in our summer activities 0:act 0:ivities 
 this year on 24 th may and again on 26th july there were held church parades in beacon hill park 
 victoria in conjunction with the other services on tho of may a detachment from tho u s coast guard cutter 
 chelan was on hand to help us celebrate hay day in good british fashion and on the 24 th july 
 we hod with us a large detachment from the h m s apollo which was paying a three day visit 
 to victoria the royal canadian navy and tho it p a m was out on both occasions in good numbers 
 and the general public was given a good show each time then on ist july came the opening of the 
 vancouver golden jubilee celebrations the feature of the day was a great naval military and air force parade of some 
 three thousand troops including about 000 from vancouver island who were taken across on the joth june on h m 
 c s skeena and vancouver and brought home again on the night july lot 2nd the oarade formed just north 
 of the marine building and marched through the city to brockton point where before the grand stand the opening ceremonies 
 of the celebration took place following this the trooos marched past the minister of national defence and then made their 
 way back to their parade grounds and billets by various routes through town it was a really fine show and 
 there was no doubt of the public appreciation as demonstrated by the thousands of spectators the camp school of infantry 
 and machine chine occupied our attention for some time after the vancouver trip and though not a large school it 
 was a very successful one the instructors at least enjoyed the weather after the rains of last springl elsewhere in 
 this issue appears the song of the school like ben burnie we hope you like it 
 16 hard on the heels of the camp school of infantry came the central camp of machine guns this wa 
 e held this pear for the first time at heals range and despite the limited space available for field firing 
 was quite successful the llth bn c h g c ab nit seventy strong came into camp for a week 
 followed by detachments from the irish fusiliers vancouver regiment and the canadian scottish regiment for the second week the camp 
 mas fortunate in having perfect weather throughout and a good deal of worthwhile training was carried out it as at 
 this camp that lieut sutherland distinguished himself as an inventor owing to a paucity of tracer ammunition 0:ammun 0:ition for 
 night firing he felt himself to be on his mettle and with the aid of some secret but potent concoction 
 and a hard afternoon s work on the part of one of the it p a m officers attending the 
 camp produced a type of round now known to fame as dipped tra cer witnesses aver that it was a 
 huge success and it undoubtedly glccdonod the hearts of the instructors the h g camp finished up on the 29th 
 august and on the ist september 3 company again put to sea this time on the h h c s 
 skeena bound for comox v 1 of ancient fame where for a week they alternated with the ships companies of 
 h h c itavy in the use of the range the machine gunners in particular getting in some good work 
 our signal section also did some ship to shore station y ork in the evenings the itaval procedure was found 
 a bit baffling but one or two important 0:im 0:portant messages did indeed get through to their addressees platoon and 
 company tactical training provided the greatest 0:great 0:est portion of our programme during this week and all portions of the 
 11 spit at one time or another were made the scene of fierce and noble encounters on labor day aptly 
 namedl in company with detachments iron h m c s skeena and vancouver 11 3 company paraded through courtenay for 
 the benefit of the city fathers and a large holiday croud and marched post in the fair grounds following which 
 they continued the movement down the highway for several days i in this issue will be found a map of 
 our route down the island which may be of interest to those who know the local geography with the exception 
 of a couple of days rain at and north of ilanaimo the weather for the march was perfect and the 
 whole operation was highly successful of course there were difficult moments lieut wiswell had one at nanaimo when he became

 the only prize they claimed for their efforts then there was some slight difficulty over the mill pay brentwood ferry

 to use it and for two hours we sat on hill bay jetty listening to some song about a doughnut

 on a recent visit to canada i had the opportunity of mooting two of the allied regiments of the rifle

 active militia on landing at victoria vancouver island from seattle u s a i went to visit a detachment of 
 the p p c l i stationed at esquimalt which is only two miles from victoria i must confess i 
 was agreeably surprised by what i saw and after seeing them again in winnipeg i realized that the p p 
 c l i can only be compared with the very best of british regiments both officers and men arc extremely 
 smart and efficient officers are kept up to a high standard of efficiency 0:ef 0:ficiency by having to instruct both 
 their own men and the non permanent active militia almost continuously they certainly 0:cert 0:ainly work three times as hard 
 as the average british officer as for the men recruits must possess the equivalent of a ist class certificate of 
 education must be at least 5 feet nine inches in height of first clans physical development and unless they qualify 
 as marksmen they stand a very good chance of being removed from tho service all these men arc expected to 
 qualify and act as instructors to tho non permanent 0:non 0:perman 0:ent militia after spending a day or two on 
 route at banff and regina i arrived at winnipeg 14 80 miles from the pacific winnipeg is the headquarters of 
 tho p p c l i here i met lieut colonel h w riven d 5 0 m c commanding 
 he is well known to many officers of the 60th and rifle brigade as he was with princess pat s 
 when they were brigaded together 0:to 0:gether in 1915 i soon realized what perfect hosts the canadians are and i 
 rarely remember having enjoyed three days more than in winnipeg under colonel riven s care all canadians i met both 
 here and elsewhere wore full of kindness and hospitality and i never want to meet a nicer let of people 
 in winnipeg i also met the royal winnipeg rifles a nonpermanent 0:non 0:permanent militia unit allied with the rifle brigade 
 this regiment was awarded the title of royal in this year s jubilee honours the officers wear much the same 
 green serge as the rifle brigade and in the hess there are various trophies 0:troph 0:ies presented by the rifle 
 brigade i think the canadian regiments deserve an much support as we can give them the non permanent units arc 
 extraordinarily 0:extraordin 0:arily keen and put up a wonderful fight against financial and political difficulties one wonders how our territorials

 royal rifles of canada these last three being allied with the king s royal rifle corps i came away from

 hollering up up going up i there s a lot of cars coming over the bridge and she guides him 
 gently by the arm but instead he jumps out in the middle of the road waves at a car and 
 yells keep it down then he ups with both hands to his mouth and roars keep t yer r r
