 this room we were shown we the old timers told us of the early years felt uneasy at this introduction
 into when they had trapped and traded with a town full of men and empty almost the indians of the
 awful loneliness of of women but mustering courage we that silent life on the long north trails reconnoitred the room
 and they all unconsciously interspersed their telling with snatches of kipliimg of emerson that had become a part of above
 them in that lonely life this homestead ofjohn spokkeli a mile the newcomers had not yet been weaned south ofcamrose

 absence of shack or any landmark the only really living day of the week often left us in doubt but
 on we went was mail day instinctively sometimes we rested by the roadside sometimes we struck a how that evening
 did fly we sang songs quicker pace leaving the leisurely trouble that had been new t wo years before and
 to follow but over us all was the lazy varsity songs anid were all very happy content of a midsummer
 day on an never had the town seen such aim inva unworked land slon of girls two and just from

 in the morning we were on the qul vive signs of battle river of hills and coulees to reach the
 street and survey this first and with the looking we found ourselves stopping place by daylight out upon the edge
 ofa high plain below us far and away below we could see the winding river the miles between us were
 criss crossed with every man s trails on the other side were plain and coulee old prospectors had told us
 that this spot far to the casual g lance all western towns from the beaten road of traffic was the
 are the same front street facing the prettiest in all inhabited alberta and railway or prospective railway for the we
 were seeing it for ourselves towns appear long before the railroad is laid sidewalks possessing every trait below of uncertainty

 in necessity walked too for ‘ the most part we strolled along 0 in the shade keeping always to alberta
 history spri away several miles along our twisty trail the trail wound round hill after hill or we could see
 the tiny settlement of du rather scallops off one big hill a narrow hamel one of the old trading posts
 of time little trail it was seeming to have just west homesteads too began to appear happened below us was
 a creek pinewith here and there a strip of cultivated hidden and still even at noon it was land thoroughly
 in keeping with their dark down there dark and cold and setting were the shyly curious french one quite believed
 that bears were seen in halfbreeds whose desire seemed to be that ver y coulee but above us stretched the
 sunshiny friendly rose covered slope to see without being seen the girls were wonderfully pretty but time women we strolled
 on munching biscuits hitting looked toil worn up the lemons possessed by all sorts of vagrant impulses perhaps we mig
 ht have succumbed to the call of shady pine and distant waterfall had we imor heard a most un ontario
 shriek far above us and there waving wild arms and uttering wilder cries was that mad woman ella the once
 stately ella an hour before her eye had been attract ed by a strange group across the valley instinct had
 told her that it was her dear lost companions the field glass certified and here she was we were glad
 to see her of course but 1 much chagrined to realize that in all probability every field g lass for
 miles had been turimed on us watching our weird uncanny moves however a tactful and now we were upon ella
 s stamping mention of ham and eggs restored us to ground and it behooved us to conduct cheerfulness and on
 we hurried ourselves soberly as befitted the school now ham and eggs on a hot july afma am friends with
 burning words we ternoon may not sound alluring but exhorted trouble to buck up and to carry when you have
 subsisted for four weary us through this all seeing village speed months on strange wild doughy things ily we emphasized
 our desires by wild and hash effects achieved by an old concentrated prods on the larboard of voman who solaced

 htier so we left the valley for the plains and were than ours halted before the post office and most
 disconcerting was the gay presented to ella s friends the schneiders the next hour must ever be a fragrant twinkly
 understanding gaze of the postmaster he knew we suffered but sternly memory real sure enough bread and wild strawberries and
 cream nothing we called for biscuits mail and lemons enmdears you to a housewife like a vio then on we
 crawled feeling the twinkly lent appetite i myself have won more eyes and the huimiourless eyes upon our friends by
 my undiscriminating appetite rig id backs but soon the friendly hillside than by any gentler graces thrust itself out to
 cover our enmibarrassment we rounded the curve amid so it was that by evening we were esstraig ht way we
 forgot our rage and lived tablished in the hearts of the schneiders iii the new glories that were granted us
 and in the evening to make stronger our foundation we sang to them now there was something so haphazard about
 anyone who could ask us to sing must the scheme in contrast to our well indeed crave mtisic it is
 wonderful how ordered down east vacations that it they love it these germans and scan appealed to us we retired
 to dream of it dinavians every shack had its banjo to be sure we had to dream three in a
 guitar or violin often home made but bed but when one has dreamed with time prosperous schneiders boasted an or
 thousands a vulgar horrible fact three gan bought on the chance that a passing and three only isn t bad
 traveller mig ht some time play to them next morning jacob offered up jump and so florence played it and
 we sang all that all was settled every strap that had we knew and much that we didn t know
 clothed our trouble had to be adjusted to but best of all as the evening mellow its limit ror jump
 was coiossa ed the germans forgot our strangeness amid softly started their own folk songs so haug htily we set
 forth and as we florence accompanying them falteringly came to the valley of our humiliation we but successfully enough to
 leave them looked at the twinkly postmaster and we in a mist of joy swept through his little one sided
 village later when we turned to future plans this time to reach the plains we had to and when ella
 uttered a wail at not hay climb aim almost perpendicular trail cut ing had the fun of a driving walking
 in the hillside there was room and just tour with our galician cart old jacob room for our cart on
 one side the ground schneider strangely softened by the music dropped uncompromisingly to the river offered to us his own
 horse jump to be on the other the hill pressed close amid used as we pleased for walking with or
 loomed over us so it was with a breath driving behind of relief that we came out on top ella
 did seem to be a jonah we never could continue for long on the right trail sometimes our gay career
 took us to a cutbank sometimes to the river sometimes to a tiny shack and sometimes to a corral but
 by these tokens we knew we were wrong and back we turned to the last forking trail nothing mattered we
 were hearing the call of the long white road to the far horizon s wall at noonm we halted at
 neat looking whitewashed homestead and a scotch woman appeared the britisher s rosiness betraying her even before she spoke scones
 cheese and milk were instantly j ump it seemed was strong and eager forthcoming so we rested and fed our
 indeed jump did promise to be an ideal selves and our jump and after drowsing companion ella had a friend
 twenty away the hottest hour we turned again to miles to the south west about twenty the road leaving the
 scotch woman to miles further on was the town of wonder what there could be in this big lacombe on
 the calgary and edmonton bare counmtry to excuse such daft like road once having reached lacombe we proceedings now it
 if were bonnie could p lan further adventures scotland from the railroad and people were taking on all sorts of
 metropolitan airs we met them several people that day all driving horses instead of the muchfavoured oxen we asked them
 all if we were on time rig ht trail just to hear them speak sometimes we listened to time full
 mouthed english tones sometimes to scotch but most often to straight canadian or american and we felt a thrill of
 excitement as we drew near to the haunts of men but at the same time the romance of the prairie
 was passing the trails were de on we went the more deeply marked generating into fenced roads the range trail
 and the occasional single strand becoming fielded farms the gumbo and fence marking the approach to civilization rough lumber houses
 were yielding to gorgeously painted structures sign boards 0 began to obstruct the view and it took little di pping
 into the future to see the 0 day when telephone wires would infest the air automobiles infest the earth and
 0 when bridge and party calls would rule sometimes tired with looking at the with iron hand it was a
 sad thought world about us we drifted back to the other world we had known to school lacombe was the
 usual town only it days to first school experiences to all that was reaching its second teenth stage we had
 learned and unlearned about chil substantial brick buildings were replacdren to old half forgotten far offthings ing the unpainted frame
 it was no doubt and just as the bluffs began to grow hazy spoken of at local banquets as our
 thrivwith evening peace we saw before us ing little city the imposing storey and a half house surely a wonderful
 structure of our friend a formidable array such as ours would have paralysed an eastern housewife but q it is
 the merest incident to an emergencymeeting westerner so it was that our again we were fortunate in finding our friend
 s welcome was unfeignedly glad friends at home moveover they were and sincere and we rested there equipped with a
 stable and they opened next day another twenty mile program their house and their stable to us and was planned
 and after that still in the our charger and allowed our cart to dark we were now not twenty miles

 blushed at the unworthy thought with strange encouraging grunts he renewed the pony and she dug in her toes and
