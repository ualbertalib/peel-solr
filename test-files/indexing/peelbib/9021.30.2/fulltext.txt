 up in the north western territory somewhere in the vicinity of medicine hat and was feeling quite lonesome so far
 away from home and civilization one day the monotony of his sojourn was broken by the arrival of a party
 consisting of general manager van horne land commissioner mctavish a mr keith of chicago lord dunsmore and captain talbot of
 the queen s army the gentlemen after enjoying the hospitality of the wealthy contractor insisted on his accompanying them as
 far as winnipeg on the trip to the manitoba capital the subject of cards was mentioned neither his lordship nor
 the british captain strange to relate had up to this time been initiated into the mysteries of gentleman langdon s
 favourite game but they expressed a desire to learn and were given sund ry lessons in blinds straddles bobtail flushes
 and jackpots by the accommodating contractor and the railroad men in the party by the time the train had arrived
 at winnipeg the scion of aristocracy and the captain in her majesty s service had become so enamoured of the
 game that they insisted on mr langdon s coming to st paul with them and giving them a few more
 lessons in the mysteries of the cards the gentlemen liked that well enough and on reaching there displayed among his
 friends numerous cheques and i o u ‘ s artistically embellished with his lordship s and the captain s autographs
 he appeared to be pleased with having found such enthusiastic pupils and when the gentlemen besought him to accompany them
 still further on the journey he accepted their kind invitation and boa rded the train for chicago with them when
 he returned from chicago his friends noticed that not only was he unable to produce any of his lordship s
 cheques but that his own chequebook had grown very thin since he left st paul yes it was quite evident
 that the britishers had at last acquired a very practical knowledge of the great american game under the tutelage of
 their accommodating guest who had ridden 2 000 miles to show them how to play lethbridge news jan 19 1888

 and to try and get its members to commit illethey had found a small bottle of glue or muci gal
 acts i had had experience with them before lage as it was called in those days in my room when
 in 19321 was arrested in the alberta hunger they suggested that this was the glue that had march been used
 on the back of the anti war stickers put when the crown concluded its case and the up around town
 on telephone poles walls etc lawyers summed up it was clear that the police i thought i had them there
 it so happened that had no evidence that i had distributed any anti i knew who had made the glue
 and how and war stickers magistrate w c sinclair was cornwhere he had made it it was his own mixture
 pelledtofindme not guilty but he said frankly made in his own home the small bottle of glue that he had
 reluctantly concluded to do so that i had was the kind used at home or in schools when the court
 was adjourned and i was free to that could be purchased n any store that sold go i thanked my
 lawyer and left the courtroom school supplies 1 explained this to my lawyer but no sooner had i started down

 police officers compare the glue used on the stickers with that in you re coming with us they said and
 took the bottle of glue found in my room the report me to the city jail there i spent a
 whole month of the police lab was that they were one and the without any idea of what my fate
 would be i was same thing i could hardly believe my ears not charged but held under section 21 of
 the there was no way that the home made glue defence of canada regulations war measures could possible be the
 same as the factory made act this gave the authorities the power to arrest glue but there was nothing that
 my lawyer or i anyone without charge to keep them in custody could do about it as far as i
 was concerned it as long as they considered necessary for their purwas a case of falsification of evidence it proved
 poses at any place selected by them to me how naive i had been to expect anything the month i
 spent in the calgary city jail was else in the atmosphere of anti communist quite an experience my cell was
 a small narrow hysteria that prevailed cubicle with an iron door in front for a bed i had another interesting
 incident at my trial con an iron cot made out of iron straps no springs or cerned an attempt by
 the police to use as their star mattress of course and one blanket the meals witness against me a certain
 roy koyich he had were mainly bologna sandwiches been the treasurer of the queen s avenue branch a wide variety
 of characters passed through the of the communist party to which i had at one time jail while i was
 there including drunks pimps and belonged in edmonton only this time he appear quite a few arrested for theft the
 worst ones were ed on the witness stand in the scarlet uniform of a the drunks who befouled themselves vomited
 sergeantofthercmp and stank to high heaven they came in at all it was the obvious intention of the prosecution hours
 of the night and made sleep impossible and the rcmp to use this person for general each day i was
 allowed out in the corridor for anti communist purposes on the witness stand a short while to walk up and
 down and get some but they didn t get very far my lawyer at once exercise but i was not
 allowed to see a lawyer challenged the relevance of his evidence de relatives or friends manding to know what his
 activities as an under the one bright spot during this whole time cover agent in edmonton had to do with
 the was the old sergeant in charge of the jail a man charge against me in calgar y the prosecution
 by the name of sullivan he was irish had been was compelled to admit that it had no relevance a
 member of the i r a and we found we had and so the man was not allowed to testify
 further many views in common at least as far as british for koyich i had only anger and contempt i
 kept ruling circles were concerned my eyes fixed on him the whole time that he was finally one day some
 rcmp officers came on the witness stand but never once did he look at for me and took me to
 their headquarters which me was on the top floor of the post office building it was common practice at that
 time for the there i was kept for some hours then taken rcmp to send informers into the communist downstairs
 and put into a police van in it were party trade unions ethnic groups and other ia several other men
 we left the city heading west bour oriented groups their role was not only to we didn t know where
 we were being taken but spy but to cause disruption within the organiza the grapevine rumour was that it would

 party and other anti fascist by the camp commandant who read us the rules forces to the war and were
 given a number mine was 279 and that prior to the outbreak of war we were aware was my name
 for the next two and a half years that the soviet union had consistently campaign we were also outfitted in
 camp clothes which ed for a collective security pact within the league included denim pants denim shirts and denim of

 cape while on the trousers was a three inch red the western democracies followed a policy of stripe down one
 leg appeasement giving concessions to hitler on his like others i was never told why i was intern promise that
 he would use his military build up ed nor were any charges ever laid against me to attack and destroy
 the soviet union we knew this was not necessary under the defence of that the governments of the west didn
 t object to hitler smashing the communists social demo party of canada publicly called on the canadian cratic parties and
 trade union movement in ger people to keep canada out of the war many they wanted only one thing that
 hit on jan il 1940 the defence of canada regu icr s mighty military machine be turned east lations were
 amended to give the government the that was why we were not surprised in 1936 power to arrest and jail
 people without charge or when franco invaded spain backed by the trial in june the communist party was declared armed
 might of germany and italy that the illegal under an order in council and its newspapwestern powers blockaded the spanish
 republic ers the clarion in toronto and clarte in quebec only the soviet union and mexico came to the were
 banned aid of democratic spain that was also why in however even before this time the arrests of 1938 czechoslovakta
 was sacrificed to hitler by communists anti fascists ief t wing trade union chamberlain in the munich pact the soviet
 leaders and leaders of ethnic group had begun union unable to get any support in the west for as we
 saw it we were arrested and interned not containing hitler then signed a non aggression primarily because we were communists
 but bepact with germany in august 1939 to give it cause we were anti fascists in a period when the
 time to build up its own military strength for the main enemy contrary to public statements by expected nazi tnvasion
 western governments was not perceived to be on sept 1 1939 hitler invaded poland and fascism but communism at this
 period jews two days later the british government declared and other anti fascists who escaped from hitler s war prime
 minister mackenzie king announced germany and sought refuge in britain were also the same day that canada would stand by
 britain interned as possible subversives and many of and on sept 10 canada formally declared war them were sent to
 internment camps in canada at first it appeared to us as if the canadian and in this country the government
 saw the war as british governments would now abandon their an opportunity to destroy the communist party policy of appeasement
 and take up the fight and other left wing labour and ethnic groups that against fascism by military and all
 other means had gained strength during the hungry thirties on this basis the communist party called for sup they were
 outlawed their mails seized and their port of the war effort leaders arrested and interned however within weeks it became
 apparent to when i arrived in kananaskis i met alderman us that neither the british nor canadian govern pat lenihan
 of calgary and one or two others ments had really changed their policies they known to me as communists or
 left wingers were still exerting all their efforts to turn hitler many others soon followed until our group numeast we
 entered what was called the period of the bered close to 40 among them were alderman phoney war when the
 western powers sat on jacob penner and school trustee andrew bilecki their arms and did nothing to attack the country
 on both of winnipeg alberta anti fascists interned which they had declared war in the meantime in addition to alderman
 pat lenihan and me finland with the backing of britain became in included bill tuomi bill repka an organizer of
 volved in a war with the soviet union we be the beet workers union and alex miller a lieved that
 prime minister chamberlain planned veteran of world war one who had also joined to use this war to involve britain
 in an anti the mackenzie papineau battalion and fought in soviet military adventure charges that this was spain against franco
 the largest group of planned were denied by chamberlain at the time internees came from winnipeg they included but history
 has since verified their correctness most of the top leaders of the ukrainian labor on sept 7 1947 the new
 york times reported farmer temple association and the workers that sweden had published documents showing benevolent association that if the
 russian finnish ‘ winter war of not all those arrested were communists sonic 1939 40 hadcontinuedfortwomoredays france were simply persons
 with left wing views of one and england would have sent a force of 50 000 kind or another who
 had been labelled as dangermen to aid finland in fighting the soviet union ous reds by rcmp informers one of
 them an since it was quite apparent to us that the west thony woytyshyn had left the communist moveem powers
 were still following their old policies nient years before and had become an avowed and that they had no intention
 of launching an all out public anti communist in kananaskis he aligned war against the nazis and were still trying
 to turn himself with the gernians apparently the rcmp the war into an anti soviet war the communist files were
 a little out of date in the kananaskis internment camp we lived every morning and late every afternoon in the
 in small huts with about a dozen people to each camp we were lined up in military fashion on the
 building at first we were dispersed among ger parade ground like prisoners of war and countnian and italian internees and
 one of our first de ed we had to answer when our number was callmands was that we be placed
 in huts of our own ed our huts also were inspected daily beds had separate froni nazis and fascists the
 camp com to be neatly made in army fashion clothes put mandant wouldn t hear of it but when pressure
 away properly and the huts kept clean by us was combined with pressure on the gov every inmate was required
 to sign up for a job ernrnent from the outside he finally agreed and but we were given some freedom
 of choice i we were given three or four huts of our own asked to be put on the road
 building gang the internment camp was not established pri because i loved the outdoors and especially the manly for communists
 rather it had been set mountains also i liked to get away from the up in 1939 for civilian internees
 of all kinds confinement of the camp and the barbed wire including fascists among german and italian for outdoor work
 we were paid 20 cents a day canadians these were mainly immigrants i worked at several jobs on road construction
 some of whom had become canadian citizens mainly manual labour with almost no machinery after the rise of the blackshirts
 in italy under of any kind finally i landed the job of water mussolini and the nazi brownshirts in germany
 boy keeping the men supplied with drinking under hitler they became followers of the fas water i was given a
 pail and had to go down into cists in their homelands their ethnic organiza the valley to a spring about
 a quarter of a mile tions received generous financial support from away at first an armed guard always accompanabroad and
 they carried on pro fascist propagan ied me but later on when they saw that i wasn t da in
 canada most of these internees were mid planning to escape i was allowed to go alone dle class types small
 business men lawyers the food in the camp was regular army rareal estate salesmen and so on the german tions
 at least so we were told while it was internees in the camp numbered several hund nionotonous there were no
 serious shortages in red there were only about 20 italians most of spite of the pilfering by germans in the
 cookthem from vancouver house the preparation of the food and its later another group of about 80 german sail serving
 was also done by inmates the germans ors were interned in kananaskis we heard that ran the kitchen and the
 cooking and so we ate what they gave us they didn t f ry bacon for these were from a
 german merchant ship that had been captured by the canadian navy some example they cut it into chunks and boiled
 it and where near mexico they were mainly young served it with cabbage or sauerkraut it was fatty germans thoroughly
 indoctrinated with stuff to digest naziism and its ideology of race superiority our relations with the german and italian they
 hated and looked on with contempt all who internees can best be described as one of unarmed didn t belong
 to the aryan ‘‘ master race of neutrality we were bitterly hostile to each other course they were violently anti
 semitic and were but we were all together in one camp and had to violently opposed to unions socialism and
 co exist as best we could democracy but we were not without allies as some of the along with the
 german and italians internees guards were friendly to us small wonder when we were officially labelled as enemy aliens a
 one considers that they were veterans of world term we greatly resented many of us were born war one had
 suffered greatly through the dein canada while others had become naturalized pression and many had taken part in struggles to
 canadians still others had applied for citizen improve their lives and in some cases belonged to ship but on the
 recommendations of the rcmp left wing labour organizations led by communhad been refused because of their labour activi ists ties
 or left wing views all of us were proud to i recall one in particular who had belonged to be
 canadians even if at times we strongly dis an ex serviceman s organization led by alex agreed with government policy
 to be called miller one of the interned communists the enemy aliens was insulting to put it mildly guard and
 i became good friends he even gave we understood of course that the government me a generous donation out of
 his wages every used this term for political reasons two weeks which i used to buy things froni the canteen
 for my comrades and me he and other weakened ideologically from the positions of guards also brought us newspapers which
 were naziism or who became friendly with us or the not allowed in camp my friend would give me camp
 administration was given the gestapo mine when i was on the work crew getting water treatment this included beatings in
 huts by a i would read it at the spring memorize as much as group of strong arm goons i
 could and then pass on the news to my com they used other methods too to terrorize and rades punish
 those who strayed i recall one instance friendly guards also took letters out for us where one such person became
 a hospital inmate which they mailed we were allowed to write a the internment camp hospital was staffed by few
 short letters each month and to receive re germans there they fed him ground glass and plies of course everything
 we wrote or received urinated in his food incidents such as these were was censored but we were not perniitted
 to re known to the camp inmates and to the administraceive magazines or books of our choice and all lion
 too but nothing was ever done about them newspapers were on the banned list a number of the germans escaped
 from the the german internees in camp were fully in camp usually it was from work gangs where support of
 hitler and had no doubt at all that he their absence might not be noticed until the late would conquer
 the world they did everything afternoon parade and roll call but as far as i they could to sabotage the
 war effort as they know none of these escape attempts was successcalled it even in camp for instance they would
 ful the authorities enlisted the help of indians take kegs of nails used for construction purposes who lived on the
 nearby reserve and who helped and bury them on the campgrounds to track down the escapees who had to make
 their they had a gestapo the nazi secret police way through wild country to reach canmore or operating in the
 camp and any german who calgary those recaptured were never brought back to camp there were usually tried in court
 the nazi attack on the soviet union had its resentenced and then transferred elsewhere the percussions in the internment camp
 too right germans also dug a number of tunnels for escape after the invasion one of the german sailors who
 purposes but they were invariably discovered had been captured and interned came over to us before they could be used
 i am a communist he said i know that one of the problems we faced in the intern this is
 the beginning of the end for hitler he will ment camp was that of keeping up our morale to never
 be able conquer the soviet union or deskeep from becoming depressed or even mentally troy communism unbalanced in jail this
 is called going stir how right he was and how courageous too bugs or stir crazy he took his life
 in his hands even in making this statement of course we respected this fact and all of us anti fascists
 took part in work physi made sure his comments did not reach the ears of cal work from the youngest
 to the oldest our the nazis i have often wondered since what beranks included young people in their twenties as
 came of this young man who was able to predict well as what we now call senior citizens we all
 the future with so much more accuracy than the realized that physical work was good for us both many political
 and military leaders in the west for our mental and physical health who publicly predicted that the soviet union we
 also organized classes among ourselves on would be finished in a matter of months a variety of subjects ranging from
 the german of course this young communist was an cxlanguage to politics we held many organized ception relations between us
 and the germans discussions on such topics as our conditions in the and italians in camp became even more strained
 camp and the demands we would make to the after the nazi attack the germans had no doubt camp commandant
 we were recognized as a sep at all that in a few weeks moscow and leningrad arate group in the
 camp and had won the right to would be in nazi hands and after the soviet have our own spokesman
 to present our case union north america would be the next target to the camp commandant other discussions were within
 the ranks of the communists and other on events taking place in the outside world the anti fascists in the
 camp intensive discussions canadian political scene the progress of the war took place on the changes brought about by the
 and soon we took part in sports and since we had nazi invasion of the soviet union there was no
 alotoftimeonourhandsmanyofustooktomak doubt in our minds that the whole character of ing souvenirs mostly of wood some became the war would
 now be changed by the unity of quite skilled at carving and wood finishing i still the western powers and
 the soviet union have a wooden goblet i niade in kananaskis the most of the debate and it was lively
 and lonely souvenir of my stay there heated concerned the question of whether or not we imposed our own self
 discipline on such the government of canada had changed its attimatters as keeping neat tidy and clean in this tude
 to the war or for that matter could churchrespect we all admired jacob penner the com ill be trusted would
 he and the canadian govmunist alderman froni wtnnipeg already well ernment really join with the soviet union in an advanced
 in years his orderly calm and me all out war against the nazis or would they just thodical way of
 tackling all tasks and problems sit back in the hope that the germans and russet an example for all of
 us sians would devour each other and the west would then step in and pick up the pieces and be
 on june 22 1941 the nazis launched their master of the whole world surprise attack against the soviet union on
 a i was one of the doubters at first i remember wide front ranging from the baltic to the black
 the remarks made by my good friend bill repka sea prime minister winston churchill who had by this time replaced
 chamberlain immed when your house is on fire he said you iately declared support for the ussr in its battle
 don t ask your neighbour s politics before you against the invaders president franklin d ask him to help put
 out the fire it was a good roosevelt did the same thing a few days later it and convincing point
 as far as i was concerned was at once obvious that british policy had we finally agreed after much discussion
 that undergone a fundamental change from one of the attack on the soviet union had changed the appeasing hitler to
 one of now taking part in an whole character of the war that there would be a all out war
 against naziism genuine alliance of east and west to defeat the nazis based on mutual interest as a result we
 enemy aliens as we had been designated by should give the war effort our full support ottawa the next logical
 step was to ask that we be we decided we should educate them released and for those of us who
 were eligible to this we did by engaging in discussions whenjoin the canadian armed forces we thought this ever we
 were near them about who we were and could happen soon but as it turned out it took why we
 were interned we talked about the war well over a year the government of canada was about tim buck the
 leader of the communist in no hurry to release the communists and anti party and about the party itself and
 we also fascists it had behind barbed wire it took a big talked about our wish to be released so
 we could public campaign before that was achieved join the army soon after the nazi attack on the soviet gradually
 the guards became interested when union we were transferred from kananaskis to we asked for permission to go to the
 toilet we had another internment camp in petawawa ontario to be accompanied by a guard we would cxnot far from
 an army training centre of the same change a few remarks with them they became name quite friendly in several
 instances and some told the july trip by train was a memorable one us although they were not supposed to
 talk to us we agreed among ourselves that we would try that they knew of tim buck or had attended
 meetto get word out to our friends and relatives and if ings where he spoke or had attended other leftpossible
 have them meet the train in winnipeg in wing meetings in this way we made a few new a demonstration
 of support this wasn t easy friends and spread the word around a bit more because we didn t know
 when we would be leav about our internment and our demand to be reing or when we would be going
 through winni leased to take part in the war effort peg petawawa internment camp our destination we got around this
 problem in an ingenious was a large place its inmates included many way the windows in the train passenger cars
 hundreds of german canadians and italian canawere barred to prevent escape attempts but it was dians as well as a
 sizeable group of communists possible to open them a few inches to let in fresh and other anti fascists our
 ranks swelled their air a commodity in short supply in the crowded numbers to almost 100 cars we prepared notes
 explaining what was one of the most prominent persons in the camp happening to us and giving our expected time
 of was camillien houde the mayor of montreal he arrival in winnipeg every time we passed a wasahuge man oversix
 feet in heightand almost section gang working on the railway tracks we as wide he was a sight when dressed
 in outdoor would drop one or two notes we were confident shorts he had been interned because of his that
 some of these workers would be sympathetic opposition to conscription the internment didn t to our cause especially since many
 were uk hurt his popularity among french canadians in rainian and belonged to the ukrainian organiza fact he was regarded
 as something of a national tion whose leaders had been interned with us hero soon after his release he was
 again elected it worked word reached winnipeg and a big mayor of canada s largest city demonstration was organized at
 the railway the highlight of our stay in petawawa was untracks but the authorities managed to foil both doubtedly the
 events flowing from the visit to the the demonstrators and us hearing of the demon camp of timothy eden brother
 of anthony stration they changed the scheduled time of arriv eden britain s foreign minister and prime mmal when it
 did a nive only a few demonstrators ister churchill s right hand man he was apparwere on hand but we
 did see a few of the rela ently on a tour of inspection in his capacity as an tives of
 some of our interned people official of the british government when he came the guards on the train were not
 the ones we to the huts of the anti fascists one of our group had in kananaskis they were a
 new group from joe wallace spoke up this was contrary to the the east all young and members of some
 special rules force in the army it quickly became obvious to us we are not enemy aliens he said we
 re that they had been given orders not to talk to us canadian anti fascists and that they looked on
 us with suspicion as far wallace was a poet a communist a pracas we knew they didn t even know
 that we were ticing catholic and in his youth had been a pro canadians or anti fascists and thought we
 were tege of prime minister wilfnid laurier the ed to get word out about what had happened and considerable publicity

 old hudson s bay shot guns scalping knives and other demonic signs terrible to martial ears instantly the fort was
 all alert three days provisions were served out extra rations of cartridges were distributed and the battalion was ordered to
 prepare for death or victory meanwhile the sound of the enemy approaching drew clearer and the suspense as they used
 to say at school when a caning was expected grew agonizing the blue books contain no account of the vows
 col amyot made during those terrible hours to be a better boy and hang rid if he ever caught him

 to the footsomewhat tempestuous first year in canada set hills and mountains and the steep cutbanks tied on the homestead
 which niy father had taken where the highwood river ran some half a mile up some 16 miles south west
 of high river we away i suppose this atmosphere and the novelty lived in a twelve by fourteen foot tent
 out on the of such a life helped my mother through it all open prairie where no fences or buildings
 were father discovered a spring of water gushing visible except one that was on the next quarter out of the
 side of a horseshoe coulee sonic quarsection south of us where the homesteader had ter of a mile away so
 a bucket brigade began fenced it built on it and had abandoned it the and a trail was soon beaten
 to it through the rich land had later been pre enipted by a family who knee high grass vines and
 flowers the size of arrived by covered wagon from the united the lard pails for water depended on our age
 it states was nice to rest under the willows which grew my father and oldest brother john were away around
 the spring and to get a drink of pure and working all summer first helping the wood cold water before
 starting hack with our load in houses to get established on the land they had the tent the water was
 dumped into empty coaloil taken some three miles away and then on the tins which held two gallons or more
 with the shepard ranch seven miles down the river my tops removed a lath frame put around the top father
 walked home from there each saturday edge and sometimes with a rope handle they evening and then got up before
 dawn on monday were a handy carrier and container to get back in time for work we three younger we
 were down to the river almost every day members of the family stayed with mother for perhaps first for a
 swim in the south fork and the greater part of the time luckily it was a fine then to fish
 where the north fork joined it and season with only a few showers of rain through what fishing that was
 first we had just willow out our well traveled boxes were stashed under poles so we were delighted when father
 brought a wooden makeshift roof and cover of sorts be us some light 25 cent bamboo ones from town side
 the tent while a coop of the same order was one day we used plain hooks baited with grasshome to
 a half dozen hens bought from the hoppers for the first few years we could always woodhouses inside the tent
 were rough made count on getting all the fish that we wanted up bedsteads table and benches a few stacked
 and down the river my brothers would put two apple boxes for a cupboard and a small light hooks on
 a line and almost counted on pulling metal stove to say the least it was very primi out one fish
 on each hook and then with loads tive the nearest neighbours were the dan of dry driftwood in our arms
 for the stove and campbells she with her first child at the age of sometimes wild raspberries gooseberries and sixteen
 they were two miles from us next to later still chokecherries or saskatoons in our the woodhouses were two bachelors
 each in a pails we would make our way back up the hills very small shack tom brierly and harry
 jack to the tent mother sometimes accompanied us son they came and ploughed up a patch of the on our
 excursions to perhaps pick the fruit or virgin soil near our tent in which was planted just to sit under
 trees and watch us later the some potatoes by just shoving them under the fish were fried in lard and
 with newly made banturned sods the crop did not amount to any nock or biscuits and perhaps wild strawberries it
 thing was indeed a gourmet meal i do not know what my mother s reaction was i i tic smut

 cannot remember that she thk article is a eonhiummuatiomu oi mrs rsmiceli reever complained or seemed depressed by it but

 ivv i limitless prairie stretching all around that i i the author s brother john was proud when he received
 his first colt prairie chickens were everywhere and whirred work but first i must tell how he came to us
 just up at our approach but we had no gun so they before we moved out from high river he
 had apwere safe from us meadowlarks sang their peared one day and apparently made up his mind sweetest of songs
 by day and frogs croaked their to adopt us for he stuck like glue he surely was lullaby at night
 from the slough bottom as we the ugliest of dogs with a yellow coat a bobtail drifted off to sleep
 herds of cattle and very red nose and yellow eyes but he was the occasionally a few horses would draw
 near to very first dog we had had and norman and i fairly graze and perhaps circle the tent in
 their cliriosity adored him one day two young indians appeared and stare at us from the camp on the edge
 of town and tried to to augment the fish we had the woodhouses catch him but he wasn t having
 any of it he took or campbells bring a few items from town for us off over the prairie until
 they gave up and he from time to time the bar u trail ran deeply returned to us that night
 so he followed us out from town and now we decided to put him to rutted across the foot of
 our homestead so that their wagons could be seen and heard by their work having seen some of the travois
 the indians rumble over a mile away this gave mother time used we easily made one to fit him on
 which we to prepare a small list of things which they were piled loads of the sticks he seemed to
 know the always willing to bring out for us this would score and for the most part did it quite
 willingly consist of the mere essentials with perhaps a box and pulled his load but sometimes in a playful of
 dried apples or prunes or a side of bacon as mood and with a roguish look in his eye he
 would luxury items in addition the hens provided a few jerk back out of his yoke and go capering around
 eggs one scrawny dominique type was very co pouncing at us and harking in great fun after his operative and
 was determined to lay her daily egg play was over he would come back and let us fit him into
 his load again and finish the job under the stove just inside the tent flap she would manage to sneak
 in undetected and then my father like most englishmen was a great would emerge with her triumphant cackle though walker
 when he wasn t at work he liked to roam sometimes gasping with the heat if the stove the prairie
 and got to know everyone that was happened to be in use within miles of us soon norman and i
 were carrying driftwood up over the steep hills was walking too a mile or more down the river to the
 quite a chore so we decided to put our dog bob to woods place where two bachelors and two un
 married sisters lived they had come out a few one day our dog bob got his nose full of years
 earlier from ontario and now had a well porcupine quills while roaming on the prairie established farm where they milked
 lots of cows he was in great misery and we didn t know what so had plenty of skim milk
 to spare so we had to do but one of the mitchell boys told us to more use for the
 lard pails we always seemed to bring him to his dad who would pull them out be carrying them and
 i remember how those wire mr mitchell tied him up very short to a wagon handles cut into our hands
 when they were filled wheel and went to work with the pliers pulling the woods were very kind and always
 had some the quills out one by one to bob s anguished cookies ready and as the place was very
 isolated howls and my sympathetic sobs we led a much and down under a steep hill i think it must
 have subdued dog with a very sore nose back again been quite an event for the sisters when we ap
 and as a special privilege mother let him lie peared none of them ever married and the re inside the
 tent bob was a wise dog and only dismaining two andrew and lizzie retired to live graced himself once this
 happened when he in high river and gave all their wealth to foster a came home carrying a half demolished
 ham he church was dripping wet so we knew he must have swam the river he feasted on it for
 a few days in the summer we saw two covered wagon and it must have been a lovely change to
 him outfits come in from the united states at differ from the gophers we trapped and cooked to feed ent
 times first were the mitchells with five him we found later that he had stolen it from the sons and
 a married daughter who had the very tent of an englishman recently arrived who had unusual name of quilla they
 had quite a lot of camped just across the river from the woods livestock and took the land just east
 of us then then came the time we later referred to as later the id stills also driving stock settled
 the night when the indian came we were all on the quarter south of us where a house of sorts
 awakened by thunder growling and growing was already built and ready for them there were nearer and the tent was
 illuminated by vivid four girls in that family the youngest opal was flashes of lightning there was an electric about
 my age so we soon became fast friends tightness in the air and the feeling of being in a my
 brothers were soon joining the mitchell boys vacuum it was frightening but it was more so in all their activities
 as they had horses to ride when we heard a large animal approach and and milk to drink later they
 loaned us one of seemingly stumble over one of the tent ropes their cows along with its calf the latter
 was kept giving it a jerk we were even more petrified on a picket with a wire weaner on its
 nose so that with alarm when something was thrown against it could only suckle the cow at milking time af
 the side of the tent beside mother and me stan ter my brother stan whom the mitchell boys had sprang
 to quickly to the tent flap and grabbed a taught to milk had taken half as our share the hatchet
 from the nearby woodpile another flash calf got his share off the other two teats of lightning revealed a very
 large indian who had unsaddled his horse and picketed it after letting our calf loose he also had thrown his
 mrs mitchell was a southerner from mis saddle against the side of the tent the indian souri and we were
 soon copying her quaint ex looked at stan and stan looked at him whenever clamations and southern drawl she was
 very the lightning allowed while the rest of us neighborly so mother picked up some american cowered behind the tent
 flap and looked out at ways from her such as making cottage cheese them and sourdough bread and using sunbonnets
 in where your papa asked the indian place of her less practical sunshade sunbonnets in an agitated whisper mother said
 to stan were quickly and easily made from any small bit tell him he asleep in the tent of material
 preferably gingham of red blue or pink check and edged with a frill then they stan did this in a
 firm voice the indian then were starched stiff to make a lovely frame for pointed to the sky and said
 something about many a pretty face and the curls or braids that riding many moons and mother said ask him
 were then in fashion tied under the chin they if he would like something to eat he grunted would not
 blow off when one ran as i was al what seemed an assent so mother hurriedly ways doing in those
 days and were a real pro reached for the night s can of milking and a large tection from the
 sun slab of bannock which she handed out he took it and established himself against his saddle now some time
 and would not have harmed us but the thunder was dying away and the rain started to how were we
 to know that pour down we all waited in a very fearful state summer unfolded beautiful days filled with for
 our heads were filled with the exaggerated the redolense of a million wild flowers blue tales of indians scalping helpless
 settlers as the lupins tiger lilies and wild roses all lending their rain became heavier mother was afraid that the
 colour to the rich prairie grass meadowlarks and indian would wa nt to come inside finally a can robins sang
 and for a time the frogs lulled us to dle was lit and we hurriedly put on what clothes sleep
 with their sleepy croaking from the slough that came to hand the boys pulled up the pegs on bottom occasionally
 a coyote woke us with his the opposite side of the tent from where the indian howling somewhere nearby possibly
 with an eye was and silently we each of us wriggled out and on our few hens then sunmier drowsed
 into fall made our way up and over the hill through the wet and the wild roses became red haws
 which were grass and pouring rain old bob who had not good to nibble on the chokecherries were thick ba
 rked or made a sound trailed along behind us on the cutbanks and the grass became browned we went a
 good half mile to the mitchell s tents into hay we remained in the tent well into and wagons where
 we roused them out of their september until the high fall winds threatened to sleep to hear our excited tale
 there was great stir put it into orbit and the tent ropes strained to hold and excitement with many exclamations
 of it down well i swam and my oh john from mrs then we awoke one morning to find that
 the mitchell they provided us with dry garme its of first heavy snow had fallen and was weighing the some
 sort to sleep in mine being one of the tent down almost upon us as we lay it was delarger
 boy s shirts mr mitchell and little reese finitely time for a move so mr mitchell came were sent into
 the other tent along with stan and again with his wagon they had a house build of norman while i
 was tucked in between mother sorts by now and we departed for high river and mrs mitchell oh what bliss
 to drowse off here we moved into fields shack the only vawarm and safe hearing the laughter and joking cant
 building father could find it consisted of one coming from the tent where the boys all lay large room with
 a small shed we put the chickens the next morning dawned clear and after we in had a well enjoyed
 breakfast of hotcakes mr the fields were a family who had arrived mitchell hitched up the wagon and drove us
 back about the same time we did and started to buy near to the tent there was no sign of
 our night visitor where we had built she was a large and dominatexcept for the empty milk pail later we
 learned ing german woman and he was a very mild little that the indian had been a rider for the
 bar u for englishman there were two children by his first wife ahoy of 17 and gertrude orgretchen just to
 deliver it after school as the boys were busy my age the woman seemed like the traditional delivering for the
 stores i did it under protest but cruel stepmother and was very proud of the role the extra money did
 help so off i would start her father had played in the prussian army she with several loaves wrapped under
 snowy irish imitated his ways that were strictly disciplinarian linens in a basket and i almost always met the and
 merciless whenever the boy appeared he same pigtailed chinese on his way to pick up or was quickly dispatched again
 but little gretchen deliver the laundry invariably the same converhad to do all the housework and was not allowed sation

 he never land and like us it did not arrive in time i had failed to stop me and ask
 the same questions watched them build their first shack during the my mother managed to keep us well fed first
 winter she was the boss and deedie as dried apples and prunes were a luxury added to she called him
 was the meek and never question the staples many people kept cows and milk ing assistant during the six months
 we had been was cheap the skim quite often was given away away they had undertaken to build a terrace
 as and some people kept hens so eggs were cheap she called it of semi detached houses and had for
 meat mother got most of the cheaper cuts hired a carpenter until he gave it up for lack of most
 often the shank which we bought so often funds only one end house was partly finished we decided the butcher
 must be calling us but they moved into that and so their first shack ‘‘ shanks he knew just what
 to go for when he was available to us it was a toss up which of us saw any of
 the family appearing we could get put in the coldest winter both buildings were just seven or eight pounds for
 25 cents which mother the outer frames and the winter turned out to he a would put into a large
 pan in water on the back of cold one built as it had been the shack had the stove to
 simmer slowly all day then at night many cracks in it through which the wind and she would remove all
 the bones and gristle and snow blew freely at times it was much colder cut the meat up small she
 would season it and than the tent which could be quite cosy when put it into any bowls available where
 it would set closed up tight and the stove was throwing its into a very delicious potted meat which would
 heat the shack was soon divided by spare sheets last for a few days thrown over cords which were anchored
 to the when spring of 1905 canie my brother stan walls to divide sleeping spaces from the living bought our
 first horse from indians camped near space also af ter finding that snow drifted the town he got a lovely
 little iron grey threethrough onto the beds ever ything we could get year old for five dollars saved from his
 winter s our hands on was nailed up on the walls around work he was a wise gentle pony and
 stan broke them it was a blessing that we had been well him to ride by himself spending practically the

 long awaited money having conic at we children soon caught up in school again last from england a team and
 wagon was bought and father was always working along with 17 together with enough lumber to build a shack year
 old john who seemed never at home wire for fencing and two milk cows there was a mother decided to
 augment the income by sell marked change when we moved out to our land in ing bread and she soon
 had a few customers the spring although there was still open prairie among the more affluent members of the corn
 shacks and fences were going up here and there munity in particular she was making the rich along the way
 it surely must have felt like luxury est nuttiest brown bread that ever was tasted and and i personally know
 it did when those first couldn t meet the demand for it it was my duty buildings were added to
 from the ones most lived in for the first year however the prairie still held logs got lodged on the
 sandbars and gravel beds our interest even though it was not so uncon on the sides of the river the
 logs arrived about a fined the river still ran hut looking back the first week or so before the men

 up the quarter section cornering on the one father try and ride the logs or roll them with many a

 was not available from a deep well mitchell boys would try to ride them down the we dug the building
 was hauled down beside the rapids which led into deep poo 1 s and this was river the boys hauled
 more lumber from a saw rather dangerous but they could all swim and mill in the mountains and the shack
 was added to would dive into those same pools and added to again later and eventually built up soon that

 spring the log drive would i never gota picture of him came down past us on its way from the
 mountains we had two men in our community who played to the lineham lumber company in high river the fiddle
 for the dances one of them was very it was launched when the spring flood was at its slow of
 speech and had a way of puffing and height but as the water went down a lot of the huffing
 as he played labouriously if there happened to be a piano available and anyone haying and the women almost tortured
 with could chord on it that helped to speed him up a bit houseflies sometimes the screen doors when the
 other one had his moods and when it was a they could be afforded were simply covered dreamy one we
 ached to wind him up at other with flies all trying to get in and invariably times he was wound
 up and we danced like crazy some did coils of sticky fly paper hung from the but one didn t
 dare criticize him or he would not ceilings to entrap them but occasionally one play at all into your soup
 in spite of all precau we could dance to anything and failing a tions everything in the way of food
 had to be fiddler the early gramophone might provide closely wrapped against them or put in closely some music and
 some including ourselves lidded containers and taken down through the might have come as far as 20 miles af ter
 a mid trapdoor in the cellar of sorts where everything night lunch of coffee and salmon sandwiches we was stored
 all the food had to be canned prewere just nicely started and never left for home served or pickled and
 then protected tightly before dawn often this was in below zero against the pesky insects weather so perhaps twelve or
 more of us were the hardships and loneliness of pioneer life tucked in between layers of straw beneath and fur
 were too much for many and they left but those robes above us in the wagon box sleigh was the

 the present postal arrangements a mail is carried from calgary to high river then a skip of forty miles is
 made and the service begins again at new oxley lie south of claresholm about 24 miles this side of macleod
 although the conveyance which carries the mails on the two ends passes right through the government will not allow the
 carrier to take a mail bag or even carry a letter to one of the settlers of mosquito creek and
 if one of them wishes to post a letter or wishes to ask for a letter he has to ride
 at least sixteen miles to do so not only does it affect the settlers in the immediate vicinity of mosquito
 creek but the stockmen of high river who have considerable intercourse with macleod through its having the office for the
 recording of brands post their letters at high river whence they come to calgary once a week thence to dunmore
 via cpr then to macleod over the gait line reaching macleod in about a week or ten days and about
 the sa me time is consumed in bringing an answer so that twenty days is now occupied in conveying the
 mails back and forward between high river and macieod while formerly the time was about four days the mosquito creek
 country is as good as any in the whole district and settlers are finding their way there fast but these
 disabilities are proving a serious drawback and should have the immediate attention of the post office department last week a
 tribune representative met post office inspector macleod and laid the matter before him but he said it was not my
 fault and i cannot help it we hope however the department will look into this matter and have it set
 right particularly as it will not involve a dollar more expense to carry the mail right from calgar y to
 macleod as formerly then it does under the present arrangements to cover both ends of the road calgary tribune july

 was we got along rather well and john mayor drove by automobile to edmonton easily to visit his brother on
 his return he wrote this after leaving maple creek the effects of the account which was published in the september
 drought were quite noticeable and the roads were issue of bulman s farm and motor magazine of fine with the
 exception of where the old trails winnipeg were cut off by fencing done by the new settlers this made it
 very difficult at times to get back we left winnipeg on the eighth of may in a into the old
 road and more than once we were halladay model j touring car it looked like a completely lost an amusing
 incident occurred good start the weather was fine and seemed here when we were directed by one old farmer to
 likely to stay as it was but it didn t when we proceed in a westerly direction to a certain
 ranch got to melita we ran into a belated snowstorm and from there to go 20 miles further and inquire
 and from there to regina it was a running fight of the dutchman who would direct us to with snow
 and mud and pretty slow running at walsh it happened that everyone we met was a that at times dutchman
 or a foreigner whom we couldn t we made it though but the condition of the understand and as a
 result we had to fish out our roads put a heavy strain on the car and another own way among
 the coulees and gulches and heavier strain on the patience and forbear we finally reached medicine hat where we ance
 of those who were in the car as it was our remained overnight and proceeded on our way to best
 efforts did not stop the flow of language calgary some of those who had never seen the always but fairness
 compels me to say that the halladay and were a little dubious of its hill very highest point we were
 able to reach fell far climbing abilities were fully satisfied when we short of doing justice to the situation at
 times made every hill in and around medicine hat we were like the mule driver in the mountains from medicine
 hat to gleichen the roads were who when the mule that carried the camping abominable as the old trail had
 been fenced in outfit fell over a cliff drew his revolver and fired and the new trails were faint and
 little travelled the six shots in the air because he had run out of were exceedingly rough there being about
 three words bad enough to be suitable bumps to the car length it was along here that i bad roads
 were not all of our troubles sharks met a weary willie who had been thrown off a who hold gasoline
 as a thing to be parted with freight train and taking pity on the fellow i only upon receipt of
 double price or more invited him to ride with me but he knowing the and storage room as a matter
 to be measured by road better than i thought it would be smoother the outside limits of the automobilist s
 ability to walking than riding over such roads he howpay were some of the other annoyances and we ever decided
 to cast his lot with me and together found men in this line of endeavor who have we bumped the
 bumps nothing to yield to the best products of the at gleichen we entered the blackfoot reserve bowery when it
 comes to a real full blooded and shortly after leaving there i encountered one and cold blooded holdup of the
 worst mud holes on the journey finding we stayed in regina a few days to give the no passage across
 the coulee for miles up and weather man a chance to get things to rights and down it nothing was
 left to do but to cross where then made moose jaw swift current and maple traffic had been the thickest
 and where the water creek through this part of the country the trails was more than hub deep in the
 attempt to cross i were pretty good and if we had been able to get suddenly found myself in the
 midst of it with the past all of the sloughs and low spots we should rear wheels spinning but the
 car not moving at have led a life of gilded ease by comparison with this point i got out of
 some of my clothes and what happened to us in the first part of our commenced to get out my
 rope and tackle with the aid of an iron tube which i earned for just very muddy roads owing to
 recent rains and such purposes and the rope and tackle i made the before reaching edmonton i got stuck in
 a machine pull itself out by winding the rope swamp and it being late i camped in my car all
 around the rear hubs night arriving in the city about noon here i met while this feat of making the
 car lift itself by my brother whom i had not seen for several its bootstraps was going on i had
 some very years i had an unusually good time and when interesting spectators in a crowd of the indians my
 visit was over i went back to calgary again who occupy this reserve an effort to get a few there
 i disposed of the car and took the train for kodak shots at these people ended in failure until winnipeg
 via lethbridge i showed them a little coin when they became on the whole the trip was an exciting one
 and very eager they flocked to the centre of the most interesting there was no time when any stage then
 and one interesting picture was taken serious danger threatened but bad roads and of them in the car which was
 packed to over trails broken by sloughs and rivers robbed the flowing some of them even hanging on the journey
 of deadly dullness and kept me busy fenders while engaged in taking the picture i most of the time studying
 how to avoid trouble discovered that some of the light fingered ones or having plunged into it how to get
 out again among them had been all through my tool bag nearly all of the way too i was alone
 and the and my travelling bag which i guess is one of the fact that i made the trip with
 so little trouble natural proclivities of the red man in his present comparatively gave me great confidence in my stage
 of civilization car for country touring from the indian reserve i pulled into a point which gave me as much
 pleasure as calgary the same evening and it was here that i any incident of the working of the car
 was the encountered my first tire trouble running a nail small amount of cylinder oil used on the trip i
 into the front tire as i stopped in front of the took three gallons from winnipeg and that lasted alberta
 hotel for the distance i went and the me all the way to edmonton and up to the time i
 difficult roads passed over it seemed to me quite started back to calgary considering that our remarkable that i escaped
 the tire troubles so route to edmonton took us over 2 000 miles of common with most automobilists country mostly
 bad at that time i consider after spending a day or two in calgary i the small amount of oil
 used a real achievement started north to edmonton i had good roads as for the motor and one which it
 is entitled to much far as red deer making the distance of 126 credit miles in five hours from there
 on i encountered yes sir yer talk about the climates of californy for oranges and british columbia for prunes remarked
 a pincher creek farmer in the windsor hotel last night but this ‘ ere climate and soil of alberta is
 the most equable and fertile i ever seed why last fall while prospecting around my place i unearthed a baled
 hay mine and the specimen i tuk to the assy offus went 2 000 pounds to the ton and again
 a neighbour o mine kind of keerless like went out a few days afterwards with pick in hand and with
 one delve found a rich turnip ledge and when a specimen was taken to the assy offus the assyer vowed
 that when the turnips were properly put through a cow crusher he would gua rantee fat cattle in the spring
