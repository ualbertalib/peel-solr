 jail term pioneer ranch had suffered similar losses to the other from what i could gather and sold out to
 poynter and sons about the fracas neither had any intentions the small time operators at that time of using the
 weapons he was carrying the were living in a ranchers paradise they shotgun wasn t even loaded and the rewere
 enjoying all the free range they could volver was accidentally discharged during use and 1 60 acres of the choicest
 land they a tussle for possession could call their own all for a 10 filing the ranchers acted on the
 assumption fee it s little wonder that these established that they more or less owned the country ranchers waged a
 battle royal against new by right of discovery and that i was here settlers who started making their appear first
 they tried to close off established ance after the hills were surveyed in 1906 07 the ranchers used every legal
 means mr inman now a resident of islay albertatook an active part in the they could think of to protect
 what they ranchers roundup during the four years chose to call their civil and property rights it was held he
 wrote this article when i can only recall one instance where gun preparing material in connection with play came into
 the action one rancher a cairn erected at the roundup site trails block the formation of school dis tened the
 ranchers round up later this tricts enforce the trespass law and any title was expanded to the big gap ranchother
 tricks they could think of to discour ers round up age a homesteader who dared threaten it was also decided
 that a wild west play their sacred domain they excused them would be staged entitled indian massacre selves with the
 thought that the hills were it was a western drama where a band o not fit for farming and they
 were doing indians attacked a covered wagon train these people a favor and killed several emigrants with bows and however

 actors to breed of pioneers good honest and sincere shoot them in the back at close range the people arrows
 would stick in the sheet cork that this change of heart was a direct result was glued to the cowhide
 armor this deof the many public gatherings at the little ceptive stunt invented by local rancher gap school built in
 1913 there the ran roif krohn sure added reality to the play chers and new settlers mingled together and every
 time a bow string was pulled resulting in a new healthy social atmos the spectators would cringe and gasp in
 horror phere with this new channel of communication ideas came to light talent was un with the dried cowhide armor

 sports began to spread the full length of the arena the only limit was speed i found this out a
 couple of it was that winter of 1913 14 that the years later when i was dragged the length seeds
 were sown that sprouted two years of the arena at full speed the damned dry later and developed into the
 ranchers cowhide got so hot from friction that it round up actually scorched my belly the first organization meeting for
 the show was held at my father s ranch in april the 1916 round up came off according 1916 since
 many of our most able young to plans with no admission charge and no nien had enlisted to fight in
 world war prize money the cowboys that competed one it was decided that a more or less in the rodeo
 events did so for sheer plealocal and experimental show be staged for sure and glory after it was all over
 nothe first year my father charles s inman body really knew who had won and nobody was named round up
 boss and george seemed to care d bryan was appointed secretary these the 1917 round up was very similar two
 men comprised the entire executive to the first one and in spite of the fact for the first two years
 of the round up it was hampered by a three day rain it and continued as manager and secretary came
 off in grand style throughout the four years the round up by this time temperance groups had was held pressured
 the alberta government into de about the only dissention at the first daring alberta a dry province all the meeting
 was in choosing a name for the barrooms closed their doors and that old show since the event would have
 a wild familiar cry belly up to the bar boys i m west flavor the titles rodeo and stam buying

 the interesting distinction which mr w b unsworth no 10 south drive toronto claims as his own in an interview
 with the news mr unsworth narrated this interesting bit of history in the month of december 1876 the settlers commenced
 bringing in little bags of wheat for trade we took all they brought and stored it in a flat warehouse
 on the bank of the river the following spring we received an order from steele bros toronto for 500 bushels
 of wheat for seeding purposes they had heard that the wheat which was being grown in the west was of
 an exceptionally good quality and they wanted to purchase some of it as an experiment it was of good quality
 the wheat we got that fall was the best red fife and it averaged 64 pounds to the bushel we
 had paid at the rate of 70 cents a bushel for it and we sold it for a dollar a
 bushel i was given charge of the shipping and helped handle every bushel of the wheat myself the flat bottomed
 boats carried it down the red river it was then taken across the state of minnesota by train to duluth
 and carried down the lakes to toronto very little wheat was grown outside of manitoba at that time all this
 wheat was grown in the famed fertile portage plains and came from the districts around portage la prairie high bluff
 burnside and other points within a radius of about 100 miles it was brought down to winnipeg by ox sled

 division under lnspector the source of the name calgary is ob ephrairn a brisebois to the red deer vious enough
 but the meaning of the word river to meet general selby smyth after in gaelic has long remained obscure this
 making contact with the general brisebois obscurity springs from the faulty translaled his men from the red deer to the
 bow tion of the word calgary given by assistant valley reaching the site of the present city commissioner a g
 irvine who in his of calgary at a point east of the centre letter of 29 february 1 876 stated
 that street bridge on the north hill crossing the calgary meant clear running water in river the police began the
 construction of gaelic this being the meaning as irvine the new post near the junction of the bow understood it
 the name he believed would and elbow rivers to this post brisebois be very appropriate and appropriate it gave the
 name fort brisebois a g irvine would have been especially in those days who succeeded macleod as assistant corn before
 the bow became polluted but to missioner took exception to brisebois ac any person with only a basic knowledge of
 tion in a letter to the deputy minister of gaelic what is obvious is that calgary does justice in ottawa
 dated 29 february 1 876 not and cannot be stretched to mean clear he stated that brisebois had acted without
 running water consulting either macleod or himself in the source to which the researcher would naming the fort he then
 recommended go when seeking to obtain information the name calgary which he explained had been suggested by macleod 2 dr

 watson kirkconnell emeritus president of acadia university mal colm maceachern former bishop of char lottetown and dr james maclean of
 glensanda the ygr of edinburgh university addressing myself to the last named on 3 and 5 june 1974 i wrote
 the popular translation given to the city of calgary is clear running water my thin knowledge of gaelic leaves me
 puzzled as to where one can find anything that would suggest clear running water in the word calgary even conceding
 that this is only an angliciz calgary house on the isle of mull scotland ed form of the original gaelic

 if this derivation is legiti gaelic speakers hearing the word caig mate then calgary or calg airidh would first think

 word is calg which is procombined word would be cala nounced calk garaidh garden at the harbour this leaves your
 alternative suggestions or something like that a derivation based on the elements cala professor maclean s reply of 1 2
 june and garadh which should be cala 1974 is worth quoting at length it provides garaidh pronounced calagary but i
 believe the definitive explanation of the gh s t ec h o e n a r it a as meaning
 of the word calgary he wrote doubtedly the genuine origin of the the popular translation in calgary al place name
 cala means bay or cove berta that the name means clear run and garadh nominative means ning water must be

 it committed some act upon the next neighbor of its owner which raised him to wrath he wrote a note
 addressed to the owner of the dog requesting him to kindly shoot the animal and despatched it by a small
 boy the boy shortly returned bearing a neatly folded note evidently written in response judge of the ire of the
 man who considered himself aggrieved by the depredations of the dog when he opened the note and read dear sir

 the colonials had a great route march this mnornimig through the streets of london the dismounted men hoofed it a
 distance of eight mniles and were a trifle weary when they got back to the palace the weather was very
 hot and close and there was more work about it than play the two bands headed the canadian contingent and
 the london scottish played for the dismounted men of the other contingents the streets were thronged with spectators and the
 boys got a splendid reception the mounted men of the various contingents about 1 500 in all went by a
 different route and took in a good part of the city upon returning to canip they rode through the infantry
 lines four abreast and arranged in the order they are to take in the coronation procession should it come off

 next to the king s colonial body guard and a fine showing they made they were easily the peers of
 the whole cavalcade the dandies of them all and were applauded on all sides the mounted men of the contingents
 readily yield the palm to the riders from the canadian prairies the finest horsemen in the world they are top
