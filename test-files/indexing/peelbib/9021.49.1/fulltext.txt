 1911 summer seasons but they were polo and serious outside competition his last with the exception of two brief when
 he made his first foray into visits he never returned to the province southern california he played the winter polo
 season at riverside and through 1913 and early 1914 he continued to host alberta teams at while there he was

 as for polo by 1925 the polo club was gone its grounds turned into a golf course meanwhile george s
 brother horatio was firmly settled at the pas manitoba in addition to an appointment as a dominion fisheries inspector his
 ross navigation company began a building program that would see as many as six boats plying the district s navigable
 lakes and rivers rather than opulent passenger vessels ross launched boats like the 87 foot sternwheeler nipawin and the screw
 steamer sam brisbin to connect outlying lumbering and mining operations with the railhead at the pas the general war time
 boom buoyed by the 1917 discovery of substantial copper deposits at mandy manitoba ensured the company s success as thousands
 of tons of ore were barged across cumberland lake and down the saskatchewan while horatio did not join up during
 the war he did offer his services to the british government and supposedly was dispatched to china to investigate the
 possibility of steamboat navigation on the yangtze river as with so much of horatio s life away from the canadian
 west the whole truth of the story is hard to determine in jurne of 1914 ross reappeared in calgary for
 the official opening of the chub s new chinook park grounds and refereed a game between his old fish creek
 chub and cochrane he was back again in january 1915 this tirne to do his part for the war effort
 appointed a major in b squadron of the 12 th canadian mounted rifles he took over as second in command
 of the regiment in march his wife letitia was listed on his service record as next of kin and her
 address given as the prestigious hotel del coronado she clearly didn t accompany him on his visit and a visit
 is what it turned out to be ross resigned his commission in september of 1915 and returned to california at
 48 years of age arid with no previous war experience he was an unlikely candidate for overseas service and his
 role was probably always intended to be helping get the regiment ready to fight with the war s end western
 canadians again began to make their annual pilgrimage to coronado and george ross was there to ensure they were treated
 well players from british columbia and alberta including cochrane s virginia ranch were all guests of the club during the
 early 1920 s ross had built a house on isabella avenue in coronado and seemed to have settled in as
 a permanent part of the prosperous island community but polo was almost finished at coronado by 1923 the number of
 matches being played had fallen dramatically and the field was used as much for horse shows anid high school the

 a strong prejudice against englishmen in the dominion everyone must admit that every englishmeni before he gets a start at
 any occupation in this country has difficulty in overcoming this antipathy it is not right that it should be so
 but we might as well face the fact the explanation has been often given in this country but it is
 likely to prove more useful if those in the old land come to appreciate what has led to the unfortunate
 situation that prevails dr gray the head of bradf ield college who has been giving the subject close attention addressed
 himself to it i ic said canada is calling to us to send her some of our best sons and
 in many cases i am sorry to say we have sent our worst when sons have been failures in the
 honie or at school parents have imagined that they will hind a happy huntiiig ground or at any rate a
 refuge in a land where there is more elbow room never was a mistake more prodigious never more hurtful to
 the reputation of england wastrels loal ers and remittarlce men they ar c the eyesores in a land that wants
 men by supporting a scheme of encouraging the best type of public school man to emigrate we shall be assuring
 canadians that they are receiving our best boys stamped with the certilicate of the head master dr gray and those
 associated with hini may accomplish something it is to be sincerely hoped that they will it cannot be that any
 defect in national character is responsible the greatest colonizing race in the world s history should have no difficulty in
 accommodating itself to twentieth century conditions in this country of imniense promise it is simply a case of all young
 nien from the old land having been given a bad name by those who canine out here first a very
 grave injustice is done to those who have followed and have everything to make them good canadian citizens there are
 many hundreds of englishmen occupying pronlinent and useful places in the hil e of the dominion and there is room
 for plenty more but most of them will admit that they have accomplished what they have after a considerable struggle
 whei e they succeeded their weaker brethren may succumb to the blows of circumstances and it is the part of

 moodie travelled the province under all kinds of conditions she is seen mere at left at aferry crossing of the
 red deer river alberta history winter 2001 daughters were responsible for the management of a frontier ranch house and care
 of a now extended family the family had come west at least in part because of a request from janet
 s cousin leslie hill to help raise his three motherless children walter moodie senior amid his son both took up
 homesteads adjoining the ranch where young walter was working then e were now three little girls three admit men and
 hired hands to feed as well as the four women themselves marion recalled it was a period of dry years
 and consequent business depression and though the country had a fascination for us young people it was an isolated life
 with all the difficulties of hard work prairie fires threatening the range and the struggle to grow garden crops in
 spite of a very limited water supply late or early frosts sudden hail storms and the depredations of gophers pocketmice
 and jack rabbits 7 it was during this time that marion unof ficially began her nursing career in the summer
 of 1893 her brother walter took typhoid and was ill a week at home before being taken off to hospital
 marion described it as a light case but the doctor evidently felt it warranted flagging down the train to take
 him in to calgary later when all three children developed scarlet fever the nursery was turned into an isolation ward
 8 it seems the little girls provided all the usual challenges of children in the out of doors but when
 one of them cut her forehead falling on a rock and there was no one near to stitch it marion
 and her mother could only draw the edges together with surgeons plaster 9 by september i 893 janet moodie was
 often ill herself marion took on the care of her mother but by the following spring the family had moved
 into calgary where janet died a few months later time must then have begun to hang very heavy on marion
 s hands in march 1895 she writes to a cousin in the east times are very hard here walter like
 most other people has been out of work all winter i don t know what he would do if he
 hadn t the yfvica and a real friend in the secretary maggie is going to school now studying for a
 teacher s second class centificate she will probably not have much trouble getting a country school she doesn t want
 a town one i had one afternoon s delightful skating in january a party of seven of us went to
 the elbow river and walter took his camera and photographed us after that first snow then thaw spoiled the ice
 and i never got any more interestingly marion says nothing to her cousin about going into nursing yet in the
 same month she wrote the letter she was twice asked to help out in the local hospital the first time
 was to sit with a dying patient on the second occasion there was a dance on in town to which
 both matron and the nurse had been invited and she was considered a sufficiently reliable person to be left in
 charge with the assistance of the danish cook less than a month later marion officially entered the calgary general hospital
 as the first student nurse alberta history winter 2001 the hospital at the time was located in haemorrhage cancer and
 scrofula are an old house bullet holes in some of the among the special cases she recalls in doors had
 had to be repaired and the her memoirs and always there was dining room doubled as an operating typhoid af
 ter a particularly horrendous room yet when necessary nine patients nine weeks on night duty with little could be accommodated
 and cared for help she herself succumbed to typhoid by matron and the sole staff nurse and spent seven weeks
 in bed the day marion entered the hospital she hospital training provided limited was immediately sent to get some rest
 experience in maternity nursing but it so that she could take charge that night was this skill for which she
 was most in leaving the nurses to sleep much of the demand as a new graduate as there next three
 weeks of night duty was spent were so few women with any training in sitting on the top step of
 the staircase the community doctors were keen to get where she could keep an eye and an ear nurses from
 the hospital she recalled on her patients then at the end of the three weeks the little cottage hospital the
 result was that the first two was abandoned the following week maternity cases in my experience marion helped move five
 patients as were private ones one being a stillwell as supplies and equipment to a new born child the other
 a fine healthy sandstone building not far from the child who arrived before the nurse original site of fort calgary
 continuing reached the house but with the doctor a twelve hour night shift throughout the in attendance in the hatter
 case when move i was preparing to dress the child the aunt entered the room and stood within days she
 was put in charge of the looking on for a minute or so then isolation ward a shack behind the
 remarked i suppose you are getting hospital which housed three children used to handling a good many babies suffering from
 scarlet fever and before in the hospital yes i replied i the second month was out she was told haven
 t kept count whereupon the by the head nurse as a bit of aunt left the inwardly trembling nurse encouragement
 that she had won her to complete her task of bathing and cap she was officially a student dressing an
 infant for the first time 3 nurse so began the next phase of marion s when they had time the
 students career private duty from the time of studied from medical texts otherwise graduation in the summer of 1898 to
 they used an apprenticeship approach early 1903 she travelled about southern learning from their seniors the doctors alberta to small
 towns and ranch and through hands on experience homes frequently leaving calgary by marion was now considered a senior train
 she would be met at the nearest nurse in charge of a junior and railway station and driven to her
 probationer but for the next three years destination by horse and buggy one both her tasks and responsibility such drive
 took six hours on a january covered the whole range from most night with the nurse squashed into a junior
 to head nurse single seat buggy between a stoutish man in a fur coat and a slighter man 4 in
 many respects marion s hospital work parallelled the experience she had when she did arrive the trained nurse gained at
 home she was familiar with was not always welcome untrained pneumonia typhoid and scarlet fever women who had previously attended
 the but hospital training exposed her to sick or a lying in charging ten dollars a much more severe frost
 bite leg week for their services were jealous amputation following a fall and sometimes spiteful when marion the hospital at

 often had unrealistic ideas about the nurse s abilities one story that survived generations of family lore involves marion arriving
 at a ranch house and after assessing the patient asks her employer where she is to sleep to which the
 rancher replies but we thought you were a trained nurse 9 marion charged 12 50 a week for maternity cases
 15 for medical and once 16 a week for a typhoid case but it sometimes happened that after hours of
 travelling and days of work the family was unwilling or unable to pay perhaps it was the prospect of a
 more certain income that induced marion to take a position in frank alberta it certainly couldn t have been the
 prospect of lighter work since she was the only nurse for an eight bed hospital there was no relief for
 night duty so she consistently worked four teen or fifteen hours a day she recalled added to this was the
 constant need for teaching here as in private nursing she tried to impress the need for cleanliness and proper treatment
 bacon or tobacco applied to open wounds simply could not be counted on to ward off infection and even those
 who might have been expected to ease her burden could not always be counted on for help marion wrote except
 in summer there wene fires to keep up and when we had no chore boy there was coal to bring
 in ashes to carny out and floors to mop had tinie and when the doctor was too busy i milked
 the family cow so that i could have milk for my patieiits marion s own refeience to her work in
 the crow s nest pass as a continuation of pioneer work was surely a bit of an understatement in addition
 to hospital maintenance and patient care she dealt with out patients whose illnesses or injuries were too minor to require
 hospitalization acted as anaesthetist dtnring surgery and stitched wounds in the doctor s absence her patients were mostly miners or
 loggers who had conic originally from britain or europe many spoke very little english this often compounded the problems of
 dealing with limbs accidentally chopped in the logging camps or bui ns which were the result of mine explosions the
 old lady in charge of the doctor s house did not hook on the patient s needs with an understanding
 or sympathetic eye and forbade the cook to do any of the preparing of food for the hospital other than
 regular full diet meals so to obtain the gruel soups and other light diets i was obliged to make them
 nnyself while i ate my breakfast standing by the kitchen stove 7 at the beginning of the 20 th century
 it was taken for granted that a nurse would do whatever needed doing in spite of professionalization nursing was still
 very much an extension of woman s work arid selfless devotion to others was still a woman s highest calling
 the ghost of the good mr sedgewick s ideal woman was a long way from being laid to rest above

 winter 2001 in turn mrs kyforuk would tell of her mother who was diabetic and who had developed a sore
 on her foot which seemed to get worse by the day it was in the late 1920 s and the
 nearest doctor was miles away in radway when they finally made it to see the doctor they were told it
 was gangrene arid too far gone she would have to have her foot amputated when her mother refused they went
 back to the farm once there they started treating it the only way they knew twice a day they soaked
 the foot in war ii water dried it then applied the balm of gilead salve the foot started healing and
 continued until it was completely better when they went back to the doctor he couldn t believe it but mrs
 kyforuk s mother kept her foot for the rest of her life people at the time ate simple foods free
 of pesticides arid herbicides vegetables thrived inn gardens with only a dressing of manure to the soil vegetable oils were
 extracted at home with a press using flax seed hemp and sunflower seeds onions and garlic were a big part
 of the settlers diet during the flu epidemic of 1918 garlic came into big demand it was claimed to be
 a cure for colds and a blood cleanser but mostly as a buffer against the flu bug when we were
 kids we sometimes had bouts with croup a neighbour lady mrs simpson advised mother to always keep a jar of
 goose grease on hand when croup settled in our chests mother would give us a tablespoon of goose grease sweetened
 with a bit of sugar this seenned to lessen the congestion and ease the coughing later i would use the
 same remedy for niy children with favourable results i once mentioned tins to our doctor inn westhock but he only
 scoffed at the idea no matter the children lived through those bouts of coughing and wheezing with good results by
 the time the l 920 s rolled anound the roads were much improved some of them were even being gravelled
 it was alberta history winter 2001 milk was also good as a poultice for wounds my father joseph andruski mentioned
 at one time how he slashed his foot with an axe while working with an extra gang building a railroad
 near prince george there was no doctor and no way of getting out of the mountains for help someone on
 the gang advised him to soak his foot in urine several times a day which he did the wound began
 to heal and he was back at work within a few days homemade salve worked well for cuts and wounds
 mrs sophie kyforuk used to tell of her father learning about the salve when he served in the austrian army
 it was made with beef tallow spruce tree resin and buds and leaves of the black poplar balm of gilead
 when boiled to a consistency of heavy cream it was ready to use it was used to heal war wounds
 and was very effective in the first days of homesteading in alberta the settlers had no choice but to depend
 on themselves in tending their sick health care was elementary at best no longer a novelty to see an automobile
 on a country road that was when the health clinic began to visit rural schools to give vaccines and to
 innoculate children against measles chicken pox smallpox diphtheria and scarlet fever miss veichornin who was a registered nurse with the
 clinic came not only to immunize the students but to talk to the parents teachers and the school board in
 our district about the need for cleanliness in schools then there was mrs mary conquest who represented the junior red
 cross who also promoted the need for cleanliness thamiks to their combined efforts the local school boar d was convinced
 to get rid of the water pail with the dipper which was shared by all the children pointing out that
 the dipper helped to spread each cold and cough and any contagious disease that was around the pail was replaced
 by a covered watertank with a tap each child had to have his own cup or glass for drinking the
 communal towel was replaced by paper towels p 1 us a bar of laundry soap the wooden floor was oiled
 at least twice a year it was only the outhouse that had to be tolerated just the way it was
 mrs conquest encouraged all children to read the junior red cross journal and to follow its rules getting the teacher
 involved helped to promote cleanliness each niorning when the students came to school the teacher inspected them for clean hair
 faces necks and hands including the fingernails when head lice appeared in school the parents were warned they were instructed
 to check each child s head if there were lice they were told to wash the hair in a basin
 of warm water to which was added a half cup of kerosene the tneatment was to be repeated in a
 week s time to kill the nits parents were advised to give their children cod liver oil to prevent rickets
 and bowed legs at this time the federal government issued a series of how to books on different subjects these
 were distributed free for the asking among them was a booklet titled how we cook in canada its recipe for
 making soup has remained with me for all time as a way of not making soup the instructions were keep
 a pot on the stove at all times add all the scraps of left over meat vegetables fat bacon rinds
 and vegetable water plus egg shells it sounded more like a slop pot rather than a soup pot but we
 didn t need the recipe for our mothers already knew how to make good soup thanks to better country roads
 the rawleigh dealer began making his rounds to farm homes in our district the caboose carrying the rawleigh goods was

 we can do in a settled country and having bridges we now have upwards of 4 000 men arid constructed

 meats arid all kinds of groceries such as i deem necessary for the wants of that day this is not
 all remember we have to keep everything that is needed in a town of the sanie nuniber of people our
 blacksmith and wagon repairers must all be kept ready also hundreds of ploughs scrapers and all kinds of repairs for
 the same now then comes a drug department where are kept all kinds of horse medicines we also have five
 doctors that travel over the line constantly for which each man pays fifty cents per month arid i will say
 here that these five men have about all they can attend to in the spring as mcii are compelled to
 live in tents arid at the commencement befone the camps are properly established men are conipclled to lie on the
 ground for probably two or three nights coming fr oni the south it causes a great deal of pneumonia which
 has carried off a few to the subsequent beyond but in a few more days the sickness will he slight
 as the climate is healthy now then how are these mcii paid each sub contractor the first of each month
 makes a pay roll of the amount carried by each man less the board and supplies he has had and
 hands the roll into langdon and shepard s office who send a paymaster over the entire litre the 15 th
 of each month and distributes about 175 000 dollars from out of a buggy this last year fell to my
 lot a good share of the time i don t envy the job there are altogether too many montana men
 here this year but i suppose that the 15 th of june will find me at it the total amount
 of supplies furnished and cash paid to keep running one now you ask what this army of men and teams
 eat step into my shoes for a day and you would get an idea of what it takes to supply
 all this north west territory and the amount of work connected with the supply department in the first place the
 horses require 1 600 bushels of oats daily which amount must all be unloaded from the train as near the
 end of the track as possible arid then loaded on freighting outfits and hauled ahead this work alone requir es
 a few men and teams now to feed this army of railroad men it requires from one to two cars
 per day of supplies these supplies are the best that money will buy our meats all come from united states

 lie calgaryl about august 10 th now as to the people in this country there are every kind every race
 and every colour and there are thousands of indians some are good and some are bad we do not look
 for any trouble with them only in the way of running off stock one thing they have in this country
 and that is law and it is lived up to when a man breaks the law here justice is dealt
 out to him quicker and in larger chunks than he has been in the habit of receiving in the states
 and he gets very little chance of appeal when guilt is fastened upon him beyond a doubt it is not
 on old time western lynch law but a law made by the queen and lived up to and enforced by
 her people take for instance the matter of liquor nobody is allowed to sell any liquor pain killer jamaica ginger
 lemon extract vanilla or in fact anything that is prepared with a drop of alcohol in it unless he has
 a permit signed by the governor of the north west territory nor can a person bring into the country such
 stuff without such permit not even for his own use all trains arc examined and should a man be detected
 his first offence is 50 dollars and costs his second 200 dollars and costs his third 400 dollars and six
 months imprisonment in a fort with ball and chain now how do they enforce this law when a complaint is
 laid that a party is disposing of such stuff about four or five mounted police appear at his door one
 man dismounts steps in and takes mr dealer in camp he is provided with a conveyance to the nearest fort
 it may be 100 miles or more and he then and there entirely away from any friends receives his dose
 and you can above top rest assured that these police play no favourites for if they do they get the
 track ia ing crew v are tcc r mere mr 1883 drivinng spikes to hold the newly same medicine that
 the dealer gets i tell laid rcnils in place you there is a way of doing it and they do
 it right from the scratch in all my experience in the canadian north west above i have never seen nor

 why such a lavish book could be produced in the fnnst place the alberta society of artists asa was founded
 in calgary in 1931 amid controversy and i nitrigue local artist harry hunt president of the calgar y art club
 began collaborating with the national gallery of canada to establish an alberta society oi artists in order to select won
 ks for national showing hunt maxwell bates roland gissing and anthony tynnell john were in the final stages of developing
 a charter when ac leighton british trained art instructor at the provincial institute of technology and art who had refrnsed
 to cooperate in the project curtly announced that he arid carl runigius had already started such a society on their
 own himnt complained that leighton had no use for canadian art which does not follow academic lines he cannot see
 anything in the group of seven claims they have no technique the national gallery anxious to get on with its
 work recognized leighton s new group arid the alberta society of artists was born besides leighton its charter members included
 such artists as f c cross james dichmonit r l harvey wes irwin l e pearson arid j s tempest
 it invited new members whose works would be exhibited but not until sixteen years later in 1946 were hunt bates
 arid other stnpporters of the rival group adriiitted from this somewhat stonniiy beginning the asa settled into the routine of
 exhibitions hg glyde became a member in 1935 arid its president in 1942 after leighton retired by this tirlie the
 asa had already become affiliated with the calgary allied arts coumncil occupied quarters in coste house arid had established an
 edmonton group glyde was followed by such artists as wes irwin marion nicoll and lllinigworth kerr in the presidency but
 the asa still had its share of infighting in 1959 a turf war broke out between the edniioniton and calgary
 branches with asa president stan blodgett threatening to resign in 1963 ilhingworth kerr and annona br own resigned over the
 selection of works to be exhibited arid a year later more resignations followed as john snow harry hunt and others
 disagreed with new exhibition regulations the problems were left to inconiiing president doug motten who quietly nesolved the internal prohlenis
