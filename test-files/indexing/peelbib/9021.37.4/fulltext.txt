 study of law and justice in the canadian west during territorial times from 1870 to 1905 is usually dominated by
 the north west mounted police when the force was created in 1873 as a symbol of federal law order and
 authority the commissioner and every officer of the mounted police were to serve as ex officio justices of the peace
 in the following year an amendment to the act respecting the administration of justice and for the establishment of a
 police force in the north west territories gave the commissioner additional judicial authority by granting him powers of a stipendaty
 magistr ate thus the police were empowered to arrest prosecute and judge law br eakers as the population of the
 territories grew the lieutenant governor in council was able to exercise his right to appoint justices of the peace thus

 it would first mounted police post in present day alberta be one of the most impottant places in the northand

 of lethbridge can be traced our new town the coming ones probably having to 1885 with the emergence of large

 arrival of the canadian pacific railway not to be outdone by the gazette the on the south side of the
 south saskatchewan river lethbridge news entered the fray in an article and the establishment of a mounted police sub published
 during the first year of the newspaper s post on the north side of the river thus just like existence
 in 1885 the news noted that since the the other communities established in the canadian summer of 1884 when there
 was only one build west fort macleod lethbndge and medicine ing on the townsite lethbridge had swelled to a hat

 the canadian prospect of it doubling by the summer of 1886 pacific railway and the north west mounted subsequent issues

 a firm belief in boosterism including the ly impressive listing of building operations in desirability of growth and material success
 a lethbridge the january 12 1887 issue of the desire to encourage growth at the expense of vir paper noted
 very few towns in the northwest tually all other considerations a high degree of or even in towns of some
 pretensions in the east community spirit coupled with a high degr ee of can show as good a r ecord

 loom up still attitude towards organized labour the poor and better next year anyone who did not support the growth
 ethic a the medicine hat times which was founded loose degree of attachment to social darwinism as a weekly in
 october 1885 carried similar a belief in the special role of local government accounts about its community in the summer
 of and a strong strain of realism 2 indeed 1886 the times published an article simply boosterism r eigned supreme
 in every aspiring entitled medicine hat 7 noting that in the prairie urban centre and nowhere is this fact more
 spring of 1883 the hat consisted of two or three evident than in the concerted efforts of the resi shacks

 years become a busy town hat to obtain a court house a resident judge regu where the thoughts of the
 population are given lar sittings of the courts and the appointment of to the attainment of wealth progressing from civilian
 justices of the peace in their respective a shanty town to a town with permanent struccommunities from their inception to
 1905 tures and a population of 260 the paper noted a key element in boosterism is the desirability that medicine
 hat and the area surrounding is of growth and material success throughout the first class for cattle raising and good
 crops have one of the two lawyers to practice law in fort macleod until 1885 when a third lawyer arrived
 ‘ suggested that a petition he sent to the fort macleod ‘ three years later the march 29 1887 issue
 of the gazette urged the government government asking that a court house be built at to pay attention to macleod
 s need for public buildings namely a customs house land and registr y ollice post office and of course a
 court house according to c e d wood the editor of the gazette and eventually a lawyer in the terntories
 and the epitome of boosterism in fort macleod the court house was the most important building he felt it should
 include the judge s clerk s and sheriff s office in addition to a court room ‘ the following year
 wood noted impatiently that fort macleod was the headquarters of the southern alberta district court yet it still did not
 have a court house instead the judge had to conduct his business in a hotel room most certainly he situation
 was unacceptable to the residents of fort macleod however by the end of january 1889 fort macleod was no closer
 to getting its court house than was medicine hat and lethhnidge aniongtlie leading fort macleod citizens who fought for in
 medicine hat in the last issue published for a courthouse was newspaperman c e d ood second the year 1887

 most intelligent and progressive two years later the lethbridge news under in effect there were three frontier communi the editorship
 of e t saunders a former mounted ties oozing potential confidence and optimism policeman urged that lethbridge with a popuof
 instilling the residents with a belief that every lation of approximately 1 400 be the site of a thing was
 within reach and nothing would be court house 2 and indeed saunders did have a denied them thus when the
 supreme court of point r burton deane who served as the suhe north west territories was established and the perintendent
 of the mounted police at lethbridge region was divided into judicial districts in 1886 from 1888 until 1902 remembered that
 in the it was no surprise when fort macleod lethbridge l 880 s court was held in a hotel room
 or the police and medicine hat all demanded court houses and barracks at other times court was held at a
 builda more sophisticated legal system this quest for ing that was provided by the north west coal and better legal
 facilities displayed a ll the elements of navigation company the lower story was one upmanship intense rivalries and a high
 designed as a theatre complete with all the trapdegree of community spirit coupled with a high pings deane remembered the
 judge sat on the degree of distrust for other competing centres 2 stage the bamster s table was just across
 the foot as early as 1884 c c mccaul 3 who was lights in the pit the dock and the
 escort were a little beyond and the court had a comprehensive far too small and unsuited for the purpose the
 view of all that went on within the limit of its vi next day he reconvened court in the old
 school sion 22 thus by 1889 the three frontier corn building 26 but at that location the judge jury munities
 in southern alberta had expressed an in lawyers witnesses prisoners and onlookers terest in obtaining better court facilities and given
 were forced to mingle together in the same that lethbridge and fort macleod were only 50 cr owded room without
 distinction as to the kilometers apart it should be of no surprise that entrance or private apartments in addition the
 rivalry between these two centres was far more spectators and witnesses interested in the differintense and bitter than with medicine
 hat which ent cases were forced to stand for two whole afterwas 175 kilometers from its closest rival namely noons
 the place being unprovided with seats lethbridge except for chairs for the judge and the the first shot in the
 struggle between fort lawyers 28 thus the old school building was macleod and lethbridge over the court house hanily suitable
 nor acceptable as a court house for issue was fired by the lethbridge news on the thriving metropolis of lethbridge
 the so february 6 1889 the paper suggested that a court called centre of social development in southern house should
 be built at lethbridge instead of alberta macleod one week later c e d wood when the government announced in
 the fall of responded to the suggestion with a scathing 1891 that lethbridge would receive 7 000 for the editorial
 in the february 14 1889 issue of the construction of a court house and customs house gazette displaying boosterism at
 its best wood combined the lethbridge news and the board of noted that a handsome permanent court house trade still
 were not satisfied continuing the at macleod was a natural since it was the legal booster tradition he newspaper stated
 that lethcentre of the southern alberta district and the bridge the coal metropolis of the north west and centre of
 the most important and what will be business centre of southern alberta expects the most populous district in southern alberta
 something more than a building fit for a back when it was rumoured that the judicial head woods town with
 a few hundred townspeople quarters might be removed from macleod to leth finally on october 27 1892 h bentley the
 bridge due to the fact that the latter was more mayor of lethbridge received a letter from j a accessible
 by rail wood suggested lethbridge ouimet federal minister of public works is a kind of go between convenient for no
 announcing that the government had granted an one expenditure of 20 000 for the construction of a despite such attacks
 lethbridge proceeded court and customs house 3 this announcement undaunted on september 16 1889 he leth was met with approval
 by e t saunders of the bridge board of trade was formed and it repeat news who wrote now that
 the question of the edly lobbied the government for a court house cost of the building is decided there should
 be no then when lethbridge was incorporated as a town further reason for delay 32 in addition saunders on december
 29 1890 with a population of asked the town council to press the department 1 478 it further intensified its
 demands for a of public works to call for tenders so that conbuilding arguing that lethbridge was the struction for
 the building could begin in the spring second largest town in the north west and the of 1893 metropolis business
 centre and distributing point although plans for the court house were cornfor the whole of southern alberta the news pleted
 the contr act for its construction had yet to demanded a court house rather than having he be awarded by
 may 1893 in fact the governorsittings of the supreme court in the dining room general in council was just considering
 the of a hotel or in a schoolr oom 25 tender m but what of the appearance of the even
 chief justice james f macleod noted that planned court house according to the news something had to be done about
 the lethbridge the most striking feature is the extreme court house situation during one of the sittings ugliness and parsimonious
 appearance of the exof the supreme court of southern alberta at leth terior 35 furthermore he size of the rooms
 was br idge on january 14 1891 macleod lamented inadequate for the purposes for which they were the fact that
 he had to hold court in the sample intended given that the court house was a pubroom of lethbridge house
 in fact macleod lie building it was thought that some pains adjourned the session because he felt the room was
 should be taken to make it sightly nd handsome boosterism was a basic tenet of early western towns here a
 lethbridge promoter displays the agricultural potential of his community about 1886 so that it may be a credit to the
 government and a r aised platform which was about ten feet wide to the town in which it stands 36
 thus the and contained the judge s desk the prisoner box news expressed complete dissatisfaction with the and tables for
 the other officers of the court the plans 37 room itself was wainscotted in wood the walls by mid january
 1894 the court house in leth were tinted a skyblue the ceiling was white and bridge was near completion however
 this did the woodwork remained in its natural colour well not stop e t saunders from encouraging town oiled and
 varnished saunders conceded that on council to make changes to the interior design of the whole he courtroom was well
 finished and the building for example he suggested that some reflected credit on the contractor mr w oliver of the
 rooms might be too sma ll most notably and was a credit to the community of leththose to be used
 by the judge lawyer s jur y and bridge 39 the town finally had its court house witnesses also he
 did not think it fitting that the but what of lethbndge s rival fort macleod judge should have to enter
 the court room with as the judicial centre for the district of southern the genera l public and pass through
 the crowd in alberta it seemed only fitting that the town should order to reach his chambers but despite such
 have its own court house but despite the fact that reservations the court house building was finally demands for a
 building were voiced as early as completed without changes in late 1898 and on 1888 and continued thmughout the l
 890 s he con november 28 the lethbndge sittings of the struction for such a building did not begin until
 supreme court were finally held in a proper court 1902 and was not completed until 1904 although house 38 fort
 macleod did not receive its court house until the lethbridge news noted that the court room nearly six years after
 lethbridge it was certainly was located on the second floor of the building not from a lack of trying and
 was twenty by sixty feet on the south side when t m daly the minister of the interior with three
 rooms on the north side for the judge visited the north west territories in the summer lawyers and jury at
 the west of the room was of 1893 he stopped at fort macleod 48 while there he met with several
 prominent stockmen of public works and sent delegations to and a joint committee of the town council ottawa 48 in
 hopes of obtaining a resident judge macleod had been incorporated as a town in and a court house these efforts
 were reinforced december 1892 and citizens who seemingly con by the gazette and its editor given that wood vinced the
 m inister that a court house was needed was now a member of the town council he used in fact
 daly indicated that he would do his best the paper to keep such matters in the minds of to convince
 the minister of public works of its readers with timely feature stories editorials this but evidently daly was unsuccessful and
 booster oriented articles in the late 1 890 s the minutes of the town council indicate that in initially the
 demands for a court house and a late 1893 tired of using his home as chambers resident judge were part
 of one complete pack chief justice macleod applied for a lease to age that is in order to have a
 resident judge occupy the customs building at macleod in order a court house was needed and in order to have
 to use part of its as a court room 42 at the same a court house a r esident judge
 was a pr er equisite time the gazette revealed that the town hall had however this idea was soon dropped
 and the been leased to the government for one year for demand for a court house came to dominate the
 court purposes it was hoped that before the lease requests from fort macleod a typical article expired plans would be
 made for the construe which appeared in the october 29 1897 issue was tion of a proper court house simply
 entitled a court house according to however such plans did not materialize wood the court house was not being asked
 for instead the town s quest for a court house was merely for the sake of having a good permanent
 severely dampened when the government acting government building here it is a real public necesupon a petition from the alberta
 bar moved the sity furthermore he suggested it could be used resident judge chief justice macleod to calgary for general
 purposes much the same way as the in the summer of l 894 according to c e d building in
 lethbridge 5 wood this was a devastating blow because by the summer of 1899 the liberal associa macleod has been
 the headquarters of the court tion and the board of trade had joined forces with ever since the first establishment
 of a court of law town council and the gazette to ask i tarte the in the territories a nd
 has during the whole of that minister of public works for a court house which time been the home of
 the resident judge 45 was ten times more necessary than any other thus town council s earlier requests to the
 public work provided for the territories 5 government for a court house most notably in but despite such concerted efforts
 there was march 1894 when they petitioned conservative still no appropriation of funds by the government d w davis he
 district s member of parliament for building a court house at macleod in its sumfor support were quickly replaced with
 pleas mer announcement of spending in july 1899 in to have both a resident judge and a court house fact
 the estimates for the territories included such on valentine s day 1895 a special meeting of construction projects as 500
 for sidewalks at the town council was held to discuss these con regina government house 200 to the customs cerns
 the outcome was the acceptance of two office at st mary s 600 for renovations to the motions the first
 resolution was to send a dele moose jaw court house and even 4 600 for a gation to edmonton to
 lobby for a resident judge court house at medicine hat conspicuous by its the second was to send a letter
 to f w g absence was a court house for fort macleod haultain conservative member of the north west however
 the gazette had heard rumours that fort territorial legislative assembly r equesting him macleod would be getting the money for
 its court to use his efforts in the direction of obtaining a house the following year because a general resident
 judge and a court house at macleod election was supposedly forthcoming 53 in other for five long years from 1895
 until 1900 the words the funding for the court house would be town council of fort macleod wrote letters sent
 an election bribe finally after several years of petitions met with members of parliament editorializing the june 29 1900 issue
 of the members of the territorial assembly he minister gazette was pleased to announce that 5 000 had of the
 interior the minister of justice he minister been designated in the supplementary estimates for a new court house for macleod
 although the the plans which were finally revealed in april paper rejoiced at the announcement it was at a 1901
 indicated that the government was thinking loss to understand why a sum larger by 1 000 of a far different
 structure than was earlier should be voted for a court house at carnduff a estimated after meeting with the minister
 of small and unimportant village 54 public works and chief architect in ottawa in six months later the new court
 house was early 1901 a f grady a member of the town nowhere near commencement let alone comple council told
 a reporter for the gazette that the tion on january 3 1901 joseph nixon the sub court house would be
 built of stone and would agent for the dominion lands office at macleod cost a princely 40 000 56 grady
 made a po int of received a letter from the department of the mentioning that given the magnitude of the
 interior indicating that the department of justice project the building could not be finished in the intended to build the
 court house but the date was summer of 1901 but as the summer undetermined once again the gazette displayed progressed
 the court house in fort macleod had the booster mentality so prevalent in the corn not yet begun in late
 june a feature editorial munity in an article dated january il 1901 the revealed for some months now we have
 heard paper suggested now is the time that every rumours of a court house months ago the plans effort should
 be put forth by the people of were said to be prepared week after week has macleod to secure a
 building which will be not passed and nothing has been done 58 by early only a credit to the town
 and the department of august 1901 the gazette asked where is the justice but suitable for the growing requirements court
 house 59 the answer to the question was of the town macleod is the headquarters of this simple it was
 nowhere to be found judicia l district and the lega l business of southern then in the fall of 1901
 problems for the alberta centres here 55 hypothetical court house went from bad to worse when it was finally completed
 the fort macleod court house stood alone in quiet splendor it is seen here in 1910 when indians put on
 a dance for the visiting prime minister wilfrid laurier when a dispute broke out over the actual site for of
 site we are referring to mr oliver and will the building the first site selected by a represen advise you
 further in a day or two after tative of the government was near the middle of receiving galinas note grier
 called the town the public square and a short distance from second council together for an emergency meeting to dis
 avenue however the government agent died cuss the matter after much discussion the counbefore his report was filed and thus
 nothing was cil sent the following message to oliver in view done stepping into the fray was a f grady
 he of the apparent difference of opinion as to the most selected a site away from the public square and
 suitable location on the town square of the court facing residential buildings on twenty third house we as the elected
 representatives of street but some of the citizens and businessmen macleod and consequently having control of the who did not
 like grady suggestion called a square in trust for the rate payers of macleod meeting of the board of trade
 to discuss the claim the right to select the location on that location at that time the board unanimously square
 65 rejected the site selected by grady and passed a despite the efforts of the community he board resolution requesting
 the mayor d j grier to of trade he mayor and the fort macleod gazette call a public meeting to
 address the issue to influence the decision the federal government this meeting took place at the town hall on merely
 confirmed the site originally selected by october 9 1902 displaying a true booster spirit grady evidently the wishes of the
 local resi grady argued we should all work in peace and dents were of little relevance in settling this issue
 good will and harmony and build up the this fact did not go unnoticed by c e d wood town
 after such a pronouncement grady in a scathing editorial dated october 17 1902 then indicated he was in favour of
 placing the which dealt with the state of politics in fort court house near the centre of the square unfor
 macleod wood used the court house dispute as tunately he did not say exactly where the centre a basis to
 attack the government frank oliver and was another citizen suggested the court house the local liberal committee arguing that the
 site should not be built where it would benefit any one of the court house was an issue in which
 everyindividual or particular group yet another resident one expressed interest wood wr ote the governsuggested a compromise solution of a
 location on ment has gone directly against their wishes as twenty second street which ran through the mid expressed clearly
 and unmistakably in public die of the square and one hundred and fifty feet meeting the opinion of the board
 of tr ade east on second avenue 6 just when it appeared representing he businessmen of the town has been
 that the compromise location was going to be brushed aside and the protests of the town accepted by the gathering
 a debate broke out over council have gone unheeded furthermore the suggestion that the whole matter should be wood broadened
 his criticism of the federal referred to the town council after much heated government to suggest that any time it
 was discussion on this motion it was eventually connected with fort macleod the town council defeated then the public meeting
 passed a reso and the board of trade these three might as well lution in favour of the compromise location
 step aside evidently the federal government despite the fact that the public meeting decided would make the decisions not to
 refer the matter to town council the latter in any event plans for the court house were considered the issue
 at its october 10 1902 meet completed by the chief architect for the departing at that time council reinforced the
 location ment of public works in july 1902 the actual selected at the public gathering 63 building contract was given
 to patrick navin of then the feder al government decided to voice cranbrook b c who had built the catholic
 its opinion when fred galinas secretary for the church at pincher creek and the cranbrook department of public works received
 a letter hospital the cost of the new court house was from mayor grier informing him about the loca estimated
 to be 20 000 which was one half tion of the court house as selected at the town the original
 rumour circulating in 1901 it was meeting nd by town council he responded curtly based upon plans used for territorial
 court houses in view of differences of opinion as to selection built at medicine hat in 1899 and red deer
 the medicine hat court house seen here did not experience the same delays and problems as those suffered by lethbridge
 and fort macleod between 1903 and 1905 the court house was the work according to the plans the lower flat
 officially opened on november 11 l 9 o 4 of the immigration shed was to be converted into finally after
 twenty years of petitions letters and a court house twenty by thirty feet and two cells lobbying the judicial centre
 of southern alberta four by eight feet with an annexed lock up guard had its own court house room and
 mess room for local police 7 the while the town council of fort macleod was western half of the upper
 flat would still be petitioning ottawa for a court house one of the retained for immigrants while the eastern half
 was arguments used was the fact that medicine hat converted to sleeping quarters for the police and seemed to be
 getting preference over the head an office for the sergeant quarters of the judicial district and indeed this makeshift court
 house was not well medicine hat did get a court house in 1899 which received by the prairie community calling
 the was five years earlier than fort macleod the court room a shabby outfit the august 6 1896 hat s
 pursuit of a court house was not nearly as issue of the medicine hat news noted there was volatile or
 troublesome as that of its two arch rivals no seating accommodation for the jury witnesses fort macleod and lethbridge in
 fact the prisoners and court attendants the furniture congranting of a court house to medicine hat incor sisted of a
 stove two tables and a chair for the porated as a town on october 31 1898 78 judge the article
 then concluded that the residents seemed to be a matter of fact almost a foregone of medicine hat were law
 abiding and peaceful conclusion but at certain times the community needed a prior to 1893 court in medicine hat was
 usual properly furnished court house to conduct its legal ly held in the reading room of the church of business
 and much like the fort macleod england then in january 1893 the public works gazette and the lethbridge news the
 medicine inspector for manitoba and the north west ter hat news expressed its dissatisfaction with the ritor ies announced that
 the immigration shed was federal government in the way of public works to be moved and converted into police barracks
 namely the building of court houses jail and court house h yuill a prominent calling the 1896 court house a
 disaster the medicine hat businessman was contracted to do news urged that a better one be built 74 when i
 tarte minister of public works and the first noted there was nothing architectural about the liberal cabinet minister to visit
 the north west building 80 it called the final product which territories stopped in medicine hat for half an cost
 7 000 he best and most substantial buildhour in november 1896 he was shown the court ing in our town
 and a credit to the house and judge s r oom when asked by mem community 9 bers of the
 liberal committee in the community between 1888 and 1905 the federal government to provide necessar y and suitable furniture for
 the built only twelve court houses to serve the judicial building tarte replied that he and his government needs of
 present day alberta and saskatwere more than willing to meet the modest chewan 82 thus the building of court houses
 in requests of medicine hat residents he noted medicine hat 1899 lethbridge 1898 and fort that at medicine hat the
 people wanted but macleod 1904 is noteworthy in addition it little he had met but few communities wherein reflected a
 climate of optimism a spirit of there was not a substantial list of wants from the boosterism and a coming
 of age in each public works department 75 community the tenacity with which the residents although the court house received
 the promised of the three communities pursued their court furniture the makeshift court house burned down houses indicates that they
 took the trappings of in 1897 thus plans were made to construct a new the administration of law and justice
 in their towns one for approximately 6 000 this was a most seriously and the building of a formal structure
 welcome announcement since the court house was most important for its psychologica l value to had been destroyed sessions of
 the supreme court instill the majesty and grandeur of the law in magistrate s court and even inquests were held
 other words law and justice must be visibly wherever a suitable room could be found but tangible in prairie communities
 debates over the given the smallness of the rooms available few location of the court house most notably in fort
 spectator s could witness the spectacle of the macleod and medicine hat clearly reflect this criminal justice system in action
 thus a new court perception house was a public necessity 76 at times the booster oriented elite of fort the
 announcement of a new court house for macleod lethbridge and medicine hat seemed medicine hat was not met with enthusiasm
 obsessed with merely getting a court house for according to the january 12 1899 issue of the their community however
 they were also con news there is one thing regarding these plans cerned with other legal matters most notably which
 is rather short sighted and that is the build obtaining a resident judge and regular sittings of ing of the
 court house of wood instead it said the supreme court in fact the campaign for a the building should be
 made of brick or stone since resident judge was second only to the crusade for both of these materials give
 residents and visitors a court house in lethbridge and fort macleod an impression of permanency and confidence in however it

 to concentrate its efthe new court house had been drawn up they forts on obtaining regular sittings of the supreme

 concerned that their community did not have two cells and offices for the officers of the court any of the
 formal trappings of the federal justice on the second floor there was to be a court room system for example
 lethbridge did not have a plus rooms for the judge and lawyers it was clerk of the court or a
 justice of the peace estimated that this structure could be built for instead a ll legal matters were processed and
 conapproximately 4 000 ducted at fort macleod the judicial centre for the when the court house was finally completed region

 lethbridge argued it junction of main and south railway streets the should have a resident magistrate two year s news

 a lso involved with roads and at the very gateway to the vast materials the council he could not be

 obtaining a resident judge then in late spring possible to create a new district with lethbridge 1902 it was rumoured
 that a new judicial district as its centre then perhaps it could be given a was to be formed it
 was to include pincher creek deputy clerk a bailiff and regular sittings of the maple creek medicine hat macleod and
 leth court bridge with medicine hat as headquarters the when the territorial supreme court was created lethbridge news was not
 pleased with the rumour the dates for the court sessions in communities it felt that lethbridge was far more acceptable
 as were set the judges would go on circuit at the centre for this new district because it should specific

 frustrating residents in fort macleod lethbndge fort macleod lethbridge and medicine hat and medicine hat barely tolerated a delay due
 to still had one more chance to get a resident judge the illness of a judge or witness at other
 times before 1905 the opportunity presented itself the sittings were changed because there was either when the federal government responded
 to nothing or too much on the docket pressure and announced it was going to appoint interestingly an announcement of
 too full a a new judge for southern alberta in the summer docket was not interpreted by local residents as
 of 1904 this decision rested with clifford sifton an indication that crime was on the increase in the minister of
 the interior according to the leth their community rather it shows that the work bridge news there could be little
 doubt as to his of the court is outgrowing the facilities for choice it had to be lethbridge for three
 reasons handling the work given the rapid development firstly the population of the town was approxi and increased population in
 southern alberta the mately 3 000 which was probably at least twice paper reiterated calls for the creation of another
 as large as any other town in alberta south of high judge 98 thus a full docket reflected growth in
 river secondly with its system of telephones the town a need for a better court system and telegraphs and r
 ailways lethbridge was far more of course the spirit of boosterism a centre of convenience than fort macleod 95 if
 postponements of regular sessions of the court and the third factor was the spirit of optimism were frustrating so was
 the fact that during the and the vitality of the town how could clifford early years little advance notice was
 given about sifton deny lethbridge but by 1905 neither the dates of the sittings in the late l 880 s
 and early lethbridge nor fort macleod nor medicine hat l 890 s the sittings of the supreme court were had
 a resident judge usually advertised two or three weeks in advance at times the lack of a resident judge in
 a com people could then make arrangements to be in munity coupled with the small number ofjudges court that day
 however this system was replaced for the territories led to problems with sittings by the practise of giving the solicitors
 private of the courts in general and the supreme court in notice two or three days in advance thus a
 perparticular for example the sittings of the alberta son who had a case before the court would not district court
 at fort macleod had to be postponed find out that the supreme court was coming to from december 18 1885
 until january 5 1886 town until two or three days beforehand or when because the session of he northwest council
 went the judge and the lawyers actually arrived in the community 90 obviously this proved to be most if they
 can possibly do so their grievance being inconvenient and as a result sessions had to be that the lawyers take
 exception to every little postponed according to the medicine hat times technicality and are supported by ‘ the no wonder
 the public are expressing their dis court ‘ satisfaction strongly at this slipshod manner of on several occasions the deputy
 attorney conducting one of the most important branches general had to ask the jps to file statements of of the
 public service ‘ thus it was suggested their work as they were not filling out the necesthat each territorial newspaper
 should have a sary forms or doing the proper paper work for standing notice of court sittings for their commu
 example w b george one of the civilian justices nity this recommendation was accepted and from of the peace at
 fort macleod sent a statement for 1895 to 1905 the fort macleod lethbridge and the year ended june 30 1905

 to be desired according to but at least george had filed a return albeit a c e d wood it
 was conducted in a rather short one from january 1897 until december piecemeal fashion in his opinion the sooner the
 1898 james grier another civilian j p for fort administr ation of justice was placed in the hands macleod did
 not file a return of convictions a of civilian magistr ates the sooner will the people few years later the

 at regina revealed that grier tyr anny of those who ar e ignorant of the law in had been appointed

 inten records indicated grier had never acted in the sified its attacks against mounted police officer s capacity as a

 take the oath feature articles and scathing editorials appeared so he could assume his responsibilities or send a in the
 paper each one indicated that this situa letter of resignation if he did not want to continue tion could not
 be tolerated much longer as it was his appointment 06 leading to increased friction between the public in medicine hat
 there were further problems and police 02 and in a january 1889 issue of his as late as 1897 the
 hat still did not have civilian paper wood went so far as to suggest that only jps in fact when
 inspector primrose of the civilians should receive justice of the peace mounted police stationed at fort macleod was appointments 03

 such as who was going to be appointed police or civilian obviously this over sight had what if any qualifications

 this left the place without police stationed at fort macleod in the late l 890 s the protection until they

 oct 14 1899 feb 6 1900 pm tragedy on the smoky river a ghastly tale was brought by recent arrivals
 from peace river in june last h taylor son of thos taylor of lake st ann was hunting on smoky
 river about 50 miles above he crossing he came upon a camp apparently deserted by everything except a dog an
 examination of the surroundings showed the remains of a human body besides the ordinary fixtures of a camp and a
 number of leaves from a diary written in french there was fifty pounds of flour amongst the belongings of the
 camp the po lice at peace river crossing wer e notified the camp was examined the diary decipher ed and
 the belongings taken charge of from the entries in the diary it appeared that a party of three had prospected
 during the summer of ‘ 98 on the upper waters of the smoky or its tributaries that they were making
 their way down the smoky during the winter and that on the way or after coming to the camp which
 was found two of the party fell ill probably of scurvy the entries in the diary indicated that one had
 died and was buried another had gone away to try to get help the writer of the diary was clearly
 the man whose remains were found by mr taylor and who being ill had been left in camp and had
 died alone there the fate of the man who had gone to look for help is unknown but it is
 surmised that he may have tried to follow the smoky down to the crossing and been drowned as there are
 many rapids over which the ice is thin all winter at any rate so far as known he has never
 been seen the situation of the camp was not more than twenty five miles across country from brick bros store
 and the adjoining settlement so hat there was no need of the men suffering or losing their lives had they
 known help was so near the bulletin has not been able to learn the names of the three unfortunate prospectors
 but the whole matter is in the hands of the police who are looking up the relatives the edmonton bulletin
 december 15 1899 growing up in alberta part two by charles h mckenzie prepared by diane mckenzie this is the
 second in a series of three articles on the life of dr charles h mckenzie he was born in watford
 ontario in 1897 and moved to the okotoks high river area where these reminiscences begin after receiving his medical degree
 from the university of alberta where the third section of the reminiscences end he practised in the coal branch area
 of western alberta his experiences there were the subject of an article doctor in the coal branch published in the
 spring 1985 issue of alberta history he then moved to saskatchewan and an account of his experiences there was published
 under the title reminiscences of dr charles mckenzie in saskatchewan history spring 1985 dr mckenzie moved to minneapolis where he
 practised gynecology and obstetrics for thirty years he died in 1980 these reminiscences were prepared by his daughter based on
 dr mckenzie ‘ s writings after i graduated from high school i the people in the tongue creek community leamed
 i was not eligible to be admitted to normal remembered me and even before i applied i was school in
 calgary since i was only seventeen asked to teach at high view school it was five years old however the
 school decided to make miles from uncle dick s house so he offered to an exception and admit me since
 i would soon give me board and room and a horse to ride in be eighteen the first session began
 august 18 e change for chores 1915 there were 154 students and i was the for teaching high view school
 i was to receive youngest in the class although i knew how smart 60 a month i had never earned
 any money other i was the pr ofessor s didn t seem to recognize it than pennies so this sounded
 like a munificent i had lots of book learning and had always been amount i figured that i would earn
 720 for the able to recite back my lessons but now i needed year but i was mistaken because the
 scottish to reassemble what i had learned and teach it to school board could figure better than i since july
 childr en and i could not grasp the ideas of the and august were holidays they figured only ten psychology
 of education we were required to do months or 600 some woodworking and i knew i was good at that
 uncle dick s life had changed considerably hadn t i made dozens of windmills but my foot since we had
 left the ranch while he was away stool was laughed at by the instructor we had in 19 11 12
 he met edith livingstone a ver y art and drawing and watercolours the teacher held fashionable spinster in watford ontario
 his up my painstaking art work as a shining example youngest sister was married to edith s brother of how
 not to do it how i hated that smug little frank when uncle dick came home he started englishman making
 plans to build a new house and such a school went on for four months a miserable mansion as he
 put up had not been seen in that four months at the end of that time i was one community
 before he made another trip back east of forty four students earning a first class to marry edith she was
 not a farmer s wife but teacher s certificate allowing me to teach any she tried hard to fit into
 the scheme of things and grade up to and including grade 12 was a good mother to vallance by 1916
 when i tried to teach one grade i made timetable after timetable hoping that by some rearrangement i could find
 a way to teach each grade in each of the four periods of the day and have time to prepare
 and grade the work all the beautiful timetables given us at normal school just wouldn t fit high view the
 first period was ninety minutes long divided into nine grades meant ten minutes for a lesson period but then each
 gr ade had to have eighty minutes of seat work there were four such periods every day if i attempted
 to correct the seat work at r ecess and noon i was not doing my duty according to the precepts
 of normal school for i was supposed to supervise the play periods and the lunch hour i sent for all
 kinds of teacher helps and magazines but i could never keep everybody busy and quiet and my schoolroom was fr
 equently bedlam at least the little girls in the lower gr ades were my supporters because i gave out gold
 stars for seat work my pupils were of all ages and abilities and interests milt cooper in ninth grade was
 six feet tall but he was well behaved and r eally tried to learn i should have enlisted his aid
 in helping with the younger gr ades but i was not able to be that flexible my grade 8 s
 were the most obstreperous george mcintosh was more interested in riding than school i couldn t keep him occupied but
 three years later he won the bareback riding championship at the calgar y stampede grade 1 consisted of two pupils
 a bright little girl of six and her ten year old brother who had downs syndrome the parents were sur
 e i could teach robert but i couldn t just when life and teaching seemed impossible something even worse happened
 i began hearcold especially when the temperature dropped to ing giggling and whispering whenever i wrote 30 degrees below zero
 school was out at 3 30 on the board at noon i discovered why i had in the afternoon but
 i stayed to prepare lessons been dressing and undressing in the dark all winter for the next day then an
 hour s ride home in the and had not noticed a large tear in my trousers dark and chores to
 do always after dark all even large enough for my hand the rest of the day ing i spent preparing
 lessons for the next day i kept my back to he blackboani but all the pupils how little daylight there
 is in an alberta winter knew why i did so i dismissed class as early as mine was a typical
 country school there were i dared but i was mortified it was the most thirty two pupils in grades 1
 through 9 and all humiliating experience of my life i consider ed needed to learn reading writing arit hmetic rapid
 quitting but could i explain why to anyone calculation grammar geography history hea lth toward the end of the year
 the school inspecand art my biggest pr oblem was to pr epare tor j w russell visited the school i
 was enough seat work to keep eig ht grades busy while anxious to have the class show up well but
 they i started living there she seemed to have adjusted and was quite happy maybe uncle dick did some adjusting
 too but not much his idea of a major adjustment was unobtrusively removing the coconut frosting before eating his cake
 instead of storming about hating coconut i moved out to the ranch in january 1916 and begn teaching the fir
 st six months wer e a nightmar e i rose early dressed in the dark and did he chores before
 breakfast then i rode to school thi e miles south and two miles east the ride took nearly an hour
 so i was away before sunrise i had a good saddle mar e and i wor e chaps to keep
 warm but that southwest wind could be bitter behaved worse than usual at noon they caught me out to school
 on a sunday afternoon we were a gopher in a snare and attempted to drown him bundled up because it
 was about 20 degr ees below in the well i don t remember what i said but i zero and
 the old car was wide open suddenly really blew up and yelled at them mr russell within a few rods
 the windshield frosted over stayed all day and said nothing but told me he we stopped thinking the radiator had
 frozen and would send his report i received it the last day was steaming but no it was a chinook
 wind of school if i had been humiliated by the trouser before we had gone another mile we had our
 incident i was now completely crushed the coats off by the time we reached school the road report said i
 was a total loss as a teacher i lacked was muddy george turned around and went home leadership poise ability
 and much more it was immediately by 8 00 that evening the snow had a final blow i had worked
 so hard and was given melted the coulees were full of running water no credit there was no one to
 turn to for comfort and the temperature was in the 60 s by midnight for many years i saved that
 report it had begun to cool and by morning it was 20 it was a terrible summer i could only
 remem degrees below zero again i have encountered ber how the students had laughed at me how the many chinook
 winds but that few hours of normal school professors had laughed at me and chinook was the most violent change
 from cold how mr russell had degraded me i finally to warm to cold that i have ever experienced decided
 to show them that i was not to be laughed the beginning of the summer of 1917 was a at
 i would continue teaching at high view until restless time the war was very much on my mind i had
 the class under control and i wanted to join up many of my friends were during the fall term september
 to christmas joining the army or the flying corps but i had things were different i became a bully and
 a promised mother to wait till i was past twenty tyrant i threshed pupils for any infraction of the before
 i considered enlisting my brother george rules sometimes i threshed whole groups for mis was tired of school all the
 moving about had been behaviour boys and girls alike i refused to let good for me academically but it had
 been bad anyone leave during school hours for any reason for george and he wasn t inter ested in any
 mor e even to go to the bathroom until one poor little schooling father too was discontent and again scared
 girl poured a whole stream on the floor tired of travelling as usual father came up with parents began to
 ask questions and to come to see a plan he applied for a chevrolet agency one me but i was
 the boss and continued to blow up saturday we went to calgary to pay for the dealerand thresh pupils at
 christmas i quit still ship with 800 i had saved from teaching school humiliated inside but externally i was totally
 in we rented a yard and office recently vacated by charge stubborn and absolutely without humour the skov lumber company
 and we were in that was the worst year of my life business there were never enough teachers for all
 the soon father was selling chevrolets and tradlittle country school so i easily found another ing chevrolets for fords it
 was george s and my teaching position at a school about six miles south job to recondition the fords for
 resale the of high river my reputation had preceded me model t was a wonderful car to work on we

 so scared they didn t break a sin a number four bearing all the rest of the car could gle
 rule for six months one girl in grade 4 was be dismantled and reassembled with an adjustable so scared of
 being threshed that she broke herself eight inch crescent wrench and a pair of pliers of thumbsucking although i had
 never made a soon we wer e pulling motors and putting in rings rule about that after six months without
 incident and pistons relining brakes and doing complete i began to regain some self esteem overhauls i lived across the
 road from school but went over the next four years george became an home to high river each weekend george
 drove expert ford and chevrolet mechanic while father me out to the school in father s old ford on always
 the expert salesman sold car s as fast as sunday evening or monday morning one very george could recondition them
 i helpe d george cold day in march of 1917 george was driving in my spare time on saturdays and
 when school this is the type of ford car which the author found to be a welcome change from riding
 horseback was not in session and to enjoy my pupils one day i told this story in the fall of
 1917 i found another school about from the reading book to gr ade 2 four and one half miles north
 of high river with two frogs were travelling together when they only twelve pupils i decided to buy a saddle
 horse fell into a pan of cream one frog said ‘ this for i could easily ride to school in
 about an hour isn t water i can t swim in it he gave up trying sank to the bottom
 and died but the second however it wasn t long before i began dnving frog said ‘ well its queer
 stuff all right but i ll any old ford that was around the garage so i sold keep trying to
 swim and he kicked and he my horse occasionally i would end up driving splashed and he finally churned the
 cream into a real lemon i remember one car which had lost a pat of butter he climbed onto the
 butter its crank to start it lacking hills as we did i jumped out of the pan and went on
 his way had to jack up the rear end put the lever forward now i said to the class what
 does this into high gear and crank the rear wheel until the story teach us motor started one night after
 school when i puzzled looks no responses finally one little finally got the car started it fell off the jack
 and boy whose mother kept cows and churned butter started down the road in high gear it veered off raised
 his hand the road into a ditch and i was able to clamber yes bobby i said encouragingly aboard before
 it tore down a fence it teaches us to always put a lid on the about this time we bought
 a chrevrolet 490 cream he ventured the 490 was the most popular car of the day it i was still
 very religious and deeply involved came in a shiny black and the price included a in the presbyterian church and
 the young left hand steerng wheel a windshield horn woo people s society i had organized the yps and den
 wheels an electrical ignition system and an i conducted the meetings and led the devotions emergency tool kit i looked
 very smart in that car i m afraid i was pretty sanctimonious teaching was getting easier and since i could
 we were all very aware of the war in europe get home every night i began to think teaching billy
 bishop the canadian ace was our hero his school wasn t too bad after all i was even begin articles
 in the saturday evening post were vivid ning to inject a touch of humour into my courses descriptions of his
 exploits and we read them avidly i quit my school sometime in may 1918 billy bishops we still had two
 hours of code and about a dozen of us went to calgary to enlist training every day and we still
 marched to meals in the royal flying corps we were all accepted at 180 paces per minute and we still

 after many retakes dr mccalla finally recorded a day three times if we had a pass but these it as
 140 90 the highest allowed things seemed like minor annoyances now after soon we were on our way to toronto

 noon i cooked up a quick snack but in the summer it is a dry warm wind and he sun
 shines evenings i discovered the fun of cooking mrs almost every day in the winter the wind is dry weidenhamer

 i tried all kinds of biscuits pies degrees below zero and hold there for a week or and cakes in
 my stovepipe oven since i was the more only one eating my cooking i have no unbiased my tent withstood
 the wind well a lthough on opinion of how good or bad it was but i thought ver y windy
 nights it used to snap and crack i it was wonderful and i thrived on it banked sod around the
 base of the three foot wall during the summer of 1919 about mid july to hold the tent tightly in
 place my door a real a forest fire broke out of control in the foothills wooden door in a frame
 faced east my stove was west of okotoks volunteers were needed to fight remarkably efficient and could warm up the
 tent the fire and of course i went i had fought prairie to 70 degrees in fifteen minutes even when
 it was fires small ones during the summers on the 50 degrees below zero outside my bed was a ranch
 we had soaked sacks in water and beat out comfortable cot with many thicknesses of brown flames paper and building
 paper under the mattress and the forest fire was something altogether differlots of blankets and quilts to pull over me
 each ent and it would have been majestic if it has not night i stirred up the fire and after
 pulling my been so terrible the fire crept slowly along the cot to within an arm s length of the
 stove crawled moss and brush intil it came to a clump of everinto bed in the morning i reached out
 one arm greens and then suddenly it would blaze up shook down the ashes threw wood into the stove shooting
 one hundred two hundred four hundred along with some kerosene soaked sawdust and even one thousand feet in the air
 the roar was filled the stove with coal i did all this with one like a tornado and the heat
 could be felt a mile away then the flames would die down but inside able but in the mud my
 racer was awful there the clump of trees would stay fiery red the tree were no fenders and mud flew
 off each wheel in trunks would sway and fall only a few remained all directions the windshield would soon become
 as black giants the fire would smoulder again opaque and i had to drive peering around the edge creeping along
 thmugh the moss and brush some of the windshield stopping to wipe the mud f r om times if ther
 e wer e a wind a blazing fire would my eyes after a mile the driver looked like he jump
 up to half a mile to another clump of trees had been rolling in the mud instead of driving and
 the inferno would be repeated my second year in my tent at longview began the volunteers were set to work
 digging a it was even better than the first i apparently had trench two feet wide and deep enough to
 stir up begun to learn about teaching since i was able to earth so the the cr eeping fire would
 be stopped prepare and correct all the seatwork hear all the at the trench the fire rangers chose a valley
 a lessons teach the students indoor and outdoor mile or more ahead of the fire and twenty of us games
 maintain good order and i never rememdug as fast as we could we had just finished and ber having to
 thresh any of the pupils my stuhad run to the clearing where our tent was located dents wer e enthusiastic
 and that year two grade when the fire caught in two evergr een clumps 8 girls wanted to continue into
 grade 9 i was they blazed up just then a burst of wind came happy to teach them and both

 anyway on dry roads it was quite comfort to be continued calgary s red light district acting on orders given
 by chief of police mackie all the houses of ill fame in the nose creek district in calgary will close
 their doors on june 1 the orders were given a few days ago and it is understood that the action
 was taken by the police on the representation of the moral and social reform league who are making a big
 move to make calgary a clean city the action of the police came as a complete surprise to the denizens
 of the red light district who had moved to the coulee they are at present occupying as soon as the
 city limits were extended and fancied that they would be allowed to practice their nefarious trade in peace many of
 the women are already looking for houses in the city and state that it is their intention to live in
 them but not to run them as houses of ill fame regina leader may 20 1911 a letter home by
 william duval in 1885 willie duval a lieutenant in 9 th battalion from quebec was one of volunteers sent west
 to quell the riel rebellion much to his disappointment he was sent to fort macleod to reinforce the town in
 case the blackfoot tn bes joined the fight he would have prefrrred to have been closer to the centre of
 the conflict in saskatchewan by the end of may with the rebellion virtually over duval and his comrades received a
 pass to visit the rocky mountains the following letter written from fort macleod on june 1 st was sent to
 willie ‘ sfamily in quebec and was published in that city s morning chronicle on june 27 th the letter
 is largely self explanatory the castle mountain which he mentions was renamed windsor mountain in 1916 to avoid confi sion
 with the more famous peak near banff the threatened fight with crees at medicine hat never materialized and the battalion
 was shipped home a short time later the list of blackfoot words at the end of the letter are interesting
 with a nu nber ofphrases being designed for conversations with the young ladies in the blackfoot camps the editor we
 arrived back here last night we had a met a mr timothe label from kamouraska splendid trip we left here
 on saturday morning at who has a store here 8 30 on horseback our party was six in number we

 the mountains before reaching the foot of castle mountain which is about 7 to 10 000 feet high after taking
 a good rest on the mountains we above the level of the sea we had to leave the horses began
 our descent as we wanted to find horses beat about two m iles from the foot of the mountain and
 fore it was dark this proved to be very hard work walk the remainder of the way it is very
 hard work and had it not been for patsie our guide i do not to climb up hese mountains as
 we have to climb think we would have found them as it is very hard over fallen trees broken by
 snow slides there is a to find one s way in the rockies we took the same great dea l
 of danger in climbing these mountains on road to return and arrived at mr beauvais at 8 30 account of
 the snow which makes it very slippery and found a ver y good dinner prepared for us afbut it is
 worth the trouble ter dinner we had a long chat about quebec etc i tell you it is a grand
 sight to be surrounded by and then left at about l 0 o clock forpinchercreek mountains covered with snow and
 ice though we a distance of some 15 miles which i am sure did were 10 000 feet high we
 could see mountains not seem more than 10 miles but all the same we around us which seemed thousands and
 thousands were pretty tired it is pretly hard work to ride about of feet above the spot where we stood

 part of europe this and especially when dressed as cowboys with those was the grandest sight i ever witnessed in

 esepesonia kisso starvth g ii dians a party of stony indians recently visited the pincher creek country in search of
 game the latter being scarce the indians were reduced to a state of starvation and were found days without food
 they received some assistance from the settlers in the vicinity col macleod sent word to mr pocklington indian agent telling
 him of the condition of the indians mr pocklington went up at once and gave them some supplies diligent inquiy
 was made and it could not be ascertained that these starving indians had either killed any cattle or attempted to
 do so this speaks volumes for the forbearance of the stonies and deserves better recognition at the hands of the
 department than to leave them destitute of food while their worthless and thieving brethern have daily rations a policy he
 ultimate end of which is to have the indians settle down and which at the same time forces one of
 the most industrious tribes to wander all over the country to sustain life cannot be classed as anything better than
 an anomaly when the rations were stopped one reason given was that many of the stonies would be able to
 get work on the railroad we pointed out the absurdity of this at the time and subsequent events have proved
 the truth of our assertions the dominion government cannot justly starve the stony indians to death even if they are
 not numerically strong while they are feeding thousands of lazy vagabonds who lie around and do nothing fort macleod gazette
 january 24 1885 doe lauder by elizabeth bailey price note the author was a well known journalist who interviewed many
 pioneers and old timers in the 1920 s thefollowing article is based on one of these interviews probably made about
 1929 her papers are in the glenbow archives footnotes have been added by the editor to meet john d lauder

 macleod polls when he was elected to represent the calgary as we drove westward reca lled lauder district on the
 north west council in 1886 we saw thousands and thousands of buffalo and john drought lauder was born of good

 our horses became terribly frightened and we spent agher parish meath county ulster ireland and most of the night holding
 them another time an a scottish mother he was educated with a view to old buffalo bull charged at me
 and chased me to entering the medical profession putting in three the camp where one of the party shot him
 down years at trinity college dublin and a year in liver before he did any damage then there was a

 the third detachment of the macleod and with a detachment of 80 men we north west mounted police was being
 recruited in drove back some 79 miles to blackfoot crossing the capital city the fact that over 800 young men

 lauder was chosen as one of a and col macleod removed a flint arrowhead from detachment of five to drive
 governor david laird the side of one of the natives and thereby literally and dogs we had an awful job
 to keep them attacked this time entirely by a hundred or more quiet you see they were so well armed
 we won women they seized the prisoner and went off in dered why the government gave them so many triumph
 with him rifles and so many rounds of ammunition we again the reserve was in an uproar the inwere so
 few whites i realized that when i saw dians now decided to capture the police and over the blond scalp
 locks dangling from the belt of they went to french s a message came to me that wily old rascal
 of a chief of the north black to go over i thought for some time for i knew foot old
 sun at one of the powwows my i would be in great danger crossing that open blood boiled and i
 thought ‘ if there were more space alone i decided to risk it i walked over of us you d
 answer for that hair in safety my fi r st sight was unnerving an indian but they had grievances too
 they were being was holding a rifle to the mouth of one of the cheated when i came on the
 job i wondered why police luckily he didn t shoot the rest of the we had such a r eserve
 supply of untouched flour police were disarmed the indians again had as our next supply was due on investigation i
 tasted excitement and as was their nature it had discovered that the new allotment was to be to run itself
 out and anything might happen it refreighted halfway from fort macleod and sold to quired the utmost diplomacy to quiet
 them this the traders needless to say i soon stopped that was finally accomplished with the help of crow well
 do i remember a terrible row on the day foot and profuse promises of tea sugar etc they after the
 new year 1882 the indians were gave back their rifles and that night a messenger always allowed to help in
 the killing of the cat was despatched hot foot for fort macleod headtie they were given the hides and entrails
 for their quarters of the police 2 work but were told not to take any other parts in a day
 or so he fastest possible time major bull elk a minor chief disobeyed this regulation crozier arrived with a hundr
 ed men member s of and broke away to his teepee with a good supply the force and civilians who
 had rushed to answer of beef the call they brought with them one of the fa when i discovered this
 with a few helpers mous nine pounders the indians now thoroughly i went over and demanded it back he refused
 quiet and eager to be reinstated in the good graces then there was hell a poppin a crowd of excited
 of those in authority came over all dressed up indians gathered i went over to the ration house in their
 finest attire to ‘ pow wow for the police to think out my next move and i sent a messenger
 turning the nine pounder on them major crozier across the ice of the bow river to inspector fran delivered his
 ultimatum ‘ i will give you all five cis dickens son of the famous novelist who was minutes to clear
 out of this they were gone in in charge of a small detachment of police at three the offender was
 taken to fort macleod lafayette french s house but after a good talking was let off it was the looking
