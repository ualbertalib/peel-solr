 1 message from the colonel of the regiment major general g g brown osj cd it is a very great 
 pleasure to have this opportunity to send my very best wishes to all members of our regimental family wherever they 
 and their families are whether they are serving in our three regular battalions or on extra regimental employment in our 
 fourth battalion the loyal edmonton regiment or now retired and serving our regiment in other capacities the past year has 
 been an exciting one for all of us not only in our training and other activities but also because of 
 the visits of our colonel in chief lady patricia to all elements of her regiment these visits play such a 
 large part in our regimental family ties and esprit de corps and therefore are closely intertwined with our training and 
 capability to defend our country it was an added bonus to have her husband lord john brabourne accompany her and 
 their son the honourable philip knatchbull to join them for the visits in canada after completing his tour as an 
 exchange student at lakefield college in ontario it was an inspiration 0:inspira 0:tion for all of us to be with 
 her during her visits they were family visits from cyprus to quebec and ontario winnipeg suffield calgary and southern alberta 
 banff and her official visit to her third battalion in victoria the informal nature of the visits and the happiness 
 of being together and sharing these events as only families can has left indelible memories for all of us i 
 wish to extend my sincere congratulations to all patricias for your incomparable efforts during this past year the outstanding united 
 nations tour and impeccable performance during the visit of our colonel in chief to her first battalion in cyprus the 
 highly successful training programme of the second battalion including a company participating with the british in live firing exercises in 
 suffield and the inspiring performance of the third battalion as they exercised their freedom of the city of victoria on 
 dominion day and their demonstration of their versatility and military skill on the parade square that afternoon before their colonel 
 in chief the great achievements of the regimental musketry 0:mus 0:ketry team at bisley the performance of the patricias serving 
 in the airborne regiment and particularly the demonstrations during lady patricia s visit and finally but by no means least 
 the splendid but much less visible work being done by patricias on staff at our schools with the militia helping 
 at the commonwealth games and those multitude of tasks which are difficult and so necessary and for which so many 
 of our regiment are called upon to perform i believe we all should recognize the unsung strong and essential support 
 which is given by the wives and families throughout all these endeavours and particularly those families whose husbands and fathers 
 have just returned from united nations duty in cyprus the past year has deen an encouraging year tor the association 
 it is good to see the renewed vigour being expressed by additions to membership and the encouraging ideas being forwarded 
 to your executive as they plot the course and direction that the association will take in the coming years i 
 look forward with great pleasure to seeing and speaking with as many as possible of you all in the coming 
 year but in the meantime have a good year 
 2 editor s page escape through russia circa 1918 pte harry drope joined ppcli in the field on 6th december 
 1915 as a member of no 3 university company he was taken prisoner at the battle of sanctuary wood on 
 2nd june 1916 and was later awarded the military medal for his daring escape through russia from a german prisoner 
 of war camp following world war i he returned to civilian life in regina and served as an alderman for 
 the city of regina 1928 29 and he was a member of the public school board from 1930 to 1934 
 he also served on the advisory board ot the salvation army and was president ot the regina chamber ot commerce 
 during the the 30s mr drope was the first national director of the air cadet league ot canada to come 
 from saskatchewan he was made a member of the order of the british empire for his work on behalf of 
 the air cadet league mr drope passed away in regina saskatchewan on 21 st april 1978 at age 79 shortly 
 before his death mr drope was requested to put pen to paper and record the experience of his escape tor 
 all patricias to share he did and this is his story the editor private h e drope mbe mm you 
 have kindly requested that i write a brief account of my escape from a german prison camp in june of 
 1918 and of necessity i can only give a brief outline of the episode i was among the p p 
 c l i s captured on june 2 1916 one of these was private b c stone of the second 
 company and he and i shared a common experience the next two years the first two months were spent in 
 dulmen lager westphalia which was a large concentration camp stone and myself and two chaps from the c m r 
 s got into trouble with the guards by refusing to work with the result that later in the day we 
 were ordered to line up with about fifty british and french prisoners and marched off to the station after a 
 two day trip by box car and passing through berlin we arrived at konigsberg near the baltic from there we 
 were dispatched inland the two c m r lads stone and myself four british reservists and about twenty frenchmen were 
 sent to a work camp at goldap east prussia we were the first british prisoners sent to east prussia the 
 barracks surrounded by barb wire was built in a sand pit being half underground with a sand floor and single 
 ply rough boarding for the walls and a slightly sloping roof double tiered bunks stretched from one end of the 
 barracks to the other we found ourselves housed with one hundred and fifty russians with whom we were to spend 
 the next eventful twenty two months the russians in their retreat from east prussia in the autumn of 1914 had 
 heavily bombed most of the towns in east prussia including goldap the russians in our camp were organized as a 
 pick and shovel gang demolishing what was left of the bombed buildings and carting it away in dump trucks and 
 we were enlisted in this work the russians were in a sorry state when we arrived as food was practically 
 non existent also they were in rags as they had had no new clothing since 1914 living conditions were to 
 say the least very tough there was no heat in the building and the winters were about the same as 
 the ontario jvinter with lots of snow fall we eight britishers were fortunate in getting at one end of the 
 barracks furthest from the latrine which was at the other end of the building and always in constant use it 
 consisted of the usual rail and six or eight pails in december 1916 about christmas time our first red cross 
 parcels arrived and were a life saver a wonderful issue of uniforms great coats woollen underwear and army boots also 
 arrived so that we were able to manage quite well it was depressing to see the conditions of the poor 
 russians who while entirely illiterate were really very decent fellows and caused us no trouble there were unfortunately so many 
 of them that we were able to offer little help except to give them our soup ration life went on 
 as usual day by day until february 1918 1 developed a sore throat and temperature i asked to be paraded 
 before a doctor and was taken to a german military doctor who took a look at my throat and put 
 me in an old house that was used as a hospital for sick russian prisoners the chap in charge of 
 the place was a russian and jewish who had never seen an anglo saxon before but he took a keen 
 interest in my welfare and did everything possible to make me comfortable after two weeks had passed lying on a 
 bunk with several other russians in the room my russian friend came in and said the doctor had instructed him 
 to send me back to my work camp i told him my throat was no better which he reported back 
 to the doctor who in turn came to see me and took a specimen which he sent to konigsberg for 
 examination in two or three days my russian friend again came excitedly in and said you have diphtherial and he 
 moved me into a little 2x4 room away from the russian sick the doctor came and gave me a shot 
 in the hip and that was the last i saw of him there i spent another month and in the 
 meantime my russian friend who spoke fluent low german spent much time trying to carry on a conversation particularly about 
 america he had two russian jewish friends also prisoners of war since 1914 one of whom was batman for the 
 chief of police of goldap and the other a muscovite who worked in a sawmill which we passed daily on 
 our way to work these fellows were also very anxious to talk to me and would come and sit on 
 their haunches in the evening discussing america i finally conveyed to them the idea that if we could arrange to 
 escape and they could find their way to america i would do all in my power to help them the 
 russian orderly was not in favour unless we went armed they indicated to me when the time was right they 
 would pass on further plans through the russian interpreter in our camp who was also jewish as you know these 
 russian jewish fellows were much superior in intellect and initiative than the rank andfile 0:rank 0:and 0:file of russian p 
 o w s and therefore had privileged jobs they had also been prisoners since the autumn of 1914 and were 
 considered by the germans to be safeties once i got back to our camp i disclosed to my few comrades 
 our plan and they thought i was crazy i started to lay by a few non perishables from those wonderful 
 red cross parcels waiting for the day to come sure enough on june 13th 1918 the little russian interpreter in 
 our camp approached me and gave me the plan to follow briefly i was to quietly walk off the job 
 before quitting time at 6 00 o clock as if i was looking for a place for personal relief walk 
 up a back lane and in the middle of the block i would find a russian with the door open 
 to a baking oven i followed this brief jaunt without incident sure enough the russian baker was there grabbed me 
 by the leg and pushed me up on top of the brick oven which was still plenty hot from the 
 day s baking i lay there until about 11 00 p m when one of my two russian pals came 
 and got me off the hot plate and off we started in the dark the muscovite was waiting for us 
 about a half mile away and from there we took off heading east it was a dark night that first 
 night but we tramped across the fields making good headway until daybreak and when dawn was breaking the only cover 
 that seemed available was a field of rye which had grown tall enough to provide very good cover by lying 
 flat on the ground we edged in singly and converged near the centre and lay down to spend the day 
 which was to be one of several spent in a rye field it was our first day of freedom and 
 while we were very tense we were enjoying it and i felt at once i had two very stalwart comrades 
 although the ability to converse was extremely limited as they did not know a word of english and my german 
 left very much to be desired we carried on for two weeks tramping all night across the fields but trying 
 to keep in line with the main highway leading up 
 3 through poland sleeping in the woods where possible or in a field of rye at the end of two 
 weeks we had exhausted what food we had started out with so when nightfall would overtake us one of my 
 russian friends would take turns approaching small communities along the highway in search of a piece of bread they always 
 seemed successful and were meticulous in dividing it equally three ways we found that all the country we were passing 
 through was under german marshall law and the german soldiers and guards were patrolling the whole country and instilling great 
 fear in the poor wretched people living there after three weeks we found ourselves by passing the town of lida 
 it had been raining heavily all night our muscovite friend was suffering from dysentery and by the time we reached 
 the heavily treed wood the other side of lida we were thoroughly soaked exhausted and shivering the rain continued with 
 the result that it seemed wetter under the spruce trees than in the open so we shook ourselves to take 
 stock of our surroundings coming to the edge of the wood we found two abandoned airplane sheds that had been 
 used by the russians or the germans we found a small door at the end of the building went in 
 took off our boots and stretched out to spend the day to rest in the early afternoon the sun broke 
 through and suddenly we heard a german voice from the side of the building there through a large knothole was 
 the red dot of a german soldier s cap he started shooting questions as to who we were and where 
 we were going one of the russians answered that we were russian prisoners the war was over and we were 
 trying to get home with that he began to shout and swear as a german can do ordering us out 
 of the shed and we would finish our sleep in straff haus there was no time for discussion on our 
 part but the muscovite chap reached the door first and the german soldier immediately raised his hand with a hammer 
 in it and shouted if he moved a step he would slug him dead the big russian was next and 
 he apparently immediately saw the german had no weapon but the hammer so he made a mad dash arouncuhe end 
 of the building and into the wood as i saw him i came out of the door on a dead 
 run and ran the long end of the shed to see my russian friend plowing through the wet spruce trees 
 like a big russian bear i gave him a shout and together we continued through the wood which was quite 
 extensive it was the last we saw of our poor muscovite comrade now there were two of us left and 
 at this paint i would like to describe my russian friend very briefly his name was uden darkovnekof about six 
 foot three and in his early thirties he was a fine looking specimen of humanity and had a heart of 
 gold which i was to discover as the days went by that night we were so exhausted that on seeing 
 a light burning in a peasant home we went and knocked on their door being russian prisoners of course they 
 were afraid to let us in however did so knowing full well the risk they were taking with the german 
 police we were at a very low ebb they gave us a warm bowl of nourishing soup and invited us 
 to lie on a big flat oven where we spent the night the small barn and the hay mow were 
 all attached to the little house and this polish peasant showed us the way up the hayloft of new mown 
 hay to spend the day again we were sleeping soundly when in mid afternoon we heard voices in the barn 
 below two german soldiers questioning our protector fortunately he was able to convince them that he had seen no russian 
 prisoners and if he had would have nothing to do with them the germans left i mention these two experiences 
 in some detail as it was the only time we sought shelter except in a wood or in a field 
 of rye during he next night we passed through the old russian front line which they had abandoned in 1917 
 after signing an armistice with germany the russians apparently retreated in haste and the german armies simply followed through to 
 the river dneiper up to this time we have been wearing our prison pants with the tell tale stripe on 
 the outside of either leg so that if seen we would be readily recognized as prisoners of war while spending 
 another day in the wood darkovnekof explained to me that he was going to reconnoitre the nearby area for the 
 purpose of trying to obtain two pairs of ordinary pants and to my astonishment he returned in due course with 
 two pairs of khaki colored cotton work pants which were well worn and faded we carried on from here for 
 another twelve days and on the night of the 1 7th of july by passed the city of minsk and 
 by daybreak 0:day 0:break found ourselves within close range of the river dneiper our last obstacle to deal with shortly 
 after daybreak we saw two peasant women with long skirts to their heels and the familiar shawl on their heads 
 walking toward the river darkovnekof accosted them and asked how we might get across the river they said they were 
 on the way to the ferry which would be leaving in a few minutes so we thought it wise to 
 fall in behind them as we were walking down the river embankment the ferryman was approaching our shoreline but to 
 our horror and amazement we saw also approaching the landing station a german corporal and four german soldiers with rifles 
 and bayonets over their shoulder marching to the same point it was too late to turn back and we had 
 the horrible feeling that our thirty five days and nights of freedom had suddenly come to an end we continued 
 to approach the ferry and to our utter amazement which we tried to conceal the two women stepped into the 
 rowboat sat down and we immediately followed without a word being said although the germans were looking us over with 
 great interest the boatman got underway and without incident we reached the other side at last we were free from 
 the fear of the germans but did not know what reception to expect from the bolsheviks we had reached a 
 little village about twenty miles south of orsha so we tramped the highway for the first time to orsha arriving 
 about dusk we went to the station and darkovenkof identified us as russian prisoners and asked if they would furnish 
 passes for the rail trip to moscow the following morning this was done and we lay down on the floor 
 of the station and had a sound sleep the train trip was uneventful and we finally reached the city of 
 moscow i suggested to darkovnekof that he enquire about the location of the american consul office and after several minutes 
 walk we were ringing their front door bell it was past five o clock and the office was closed however 
 a member of the staff came to the door and enquired of our business for the first time i was 
 able to say we wished to see the american consul who approached us following a brief introduction he said you 
 want the british consul and they are located in the hotel metropole i will be pleased to drive you there 
 in my car he acted at once and we found ourselves sitting in the back seat of a very fine 
 convertible sedan with captain eugene prince the american consul as our chauffeur on arrival at the hotel and the floor 
 on which the british consulate was living we were introduced to mr bruce lockhart the british consular agent and captain 
 hill and three or four other staff members it was true to say that they greeted us like long lost 
 brothers and started plying us with questions when i told captain hill that i was a member of the p 
 p c l i to my amazement he stated that he had been an original member of the p pc 
 l i but now was in charge of espionage for the british government tea and biscuits were served at once 
 they explained that while they were glad to see us we were out of the frying pan into the fire 
 as the revolution was at a very critical stage and they realized they might have to escape to save their 
 own lives any day they had no room for us in the hotel but got in touch with the american 
 v m c a that was still staffed by two americans they said they would gladly put us up for 
 a few days captain hill was very concerned as to how i might get out of the country so in 
 the next two or three days he visited four or five of the bolshevik cabinet ministers and with myself in 
 tow explained my predicament and requested a passport in each instance the minister questioned simply stated that there were no 
 open ports out of russia so why a passport about 5 00 p m on the seventh day in moscow 
 he looked me up at the v m c a with his car and said grab your cap and come 
 with me to the consulate office on the way over he informed me 
 4 that an important mission of five britishers headed by sir william clark of the foreign office had arrived in 
 the city that morning by train they had come down by train from archangel and when discovering the state of 
 affairs in petrograd and moscow and on the urgent advice of mr lockhart they decided to return to archangel on 
 the evening train leaving moscow on being informed that i was in moscow and that a passport had not been 
 available sir william said immediately he and his party would take the gamble and attach me to their group they 
 were standing outside the consular office with their briefcases 0:brief 0:cases when captain hill and i arrived i was simply 
 introduced as canada and we headed for the railway station and got aboard the car without being questioned by the 
 guards i do not recall at this time how long it took to reach archangel but reach it we did 
 disembarked from the car and walked a short distance to the dock and boarded a russian ship which apparently was 
 waiting for the clark party s arrival on board were all the allied embassy leaving russia for the last time 
 after a two day journey by ship and box car we reached murmansk 0:mur 0:mansk on the arctic coast there 
 were british and american troops stationed there and our party was issued army rations from the british stores the clark 
 party lived in the box car for eight days and i had been impressed as cook and fared extremely well 
 after eight days we boarded a british ship and following a five day sea voyage docked at newcastle on tyne 
 on the thirteenth of august it was a short rail journey to london which we reached toward evening after two 
 years and two months i found myself among real friends i cannot attempt to recite the wonderful experiences i had 
 in england and on my return to our beloved canada if this story has any reader interest it is chiefly 
 because i was informed by the war office in london that an australian and myself had been the only british 
 prisoners to have escaped through russia at least up to mid august 1918 notes i pte h e drope obe

 5 the first battalion captain r romses the period from september 1977 to september 1978 has been reverently etched into 
 first battalion s history with an awe inspiring number of events this was a year which saw the battalion once 
 again serving at home and abroad members of the first proudly displayed their best on many occasions in september 1977

 pace starting with a combat leaders course and sending the rifle companies out to train in the canadian wilderness not 
 forgetting the assault pioneer platoon we sent them way up north to participate in operation morning light throughout this time 
 we also managed to host an exchange with some fine california friends so that they experience first hand the dreaded 
 yellow snow phenomenon simultaneously a platoon from the first ate up the california sunshine concurrently with activities such as exercise 
 medicine man v a sports tabloid exercise holly v the french grey cup and exercise northern passage 1977 ended with 
 a change of regimental sergeants major cwo a mcmillan mmm cd was posted to the special service force and was 
 replaced by cwo w a colbourne cd promoted from the third battalion 10 nov 77 saw the 29th running of 
 the annual french grey cup played this year at mcmahon stadium with combat support company losing to c company suddenly 
 in february before the snowdrifts could melt we were preparing for cyprus with exercise green line and a battalion reorganization 
 it seemed that even before the exercise was over we were settled into a daily cypriot routine under the blazing 
 mediterranean sun which shone well into september 1978 exercise medicine man v for the second consecutive year the battalion was 
 involved in the live fire battle group exercises held at cfb suffield under the auspices of the british army training 
 unit suffield batus a composite mechanized company under the command of major crabbe joined with a company of scots guards 
 a squadron 5 inniskilling dragoon guards b squadron 4 royal tank regiment and a battery of 105 mm abbots from 
 the royal artillery to form the battle group the exercise was preceeded by two weeks of basic mechanized training and 
 live firing in the back woods of wainwright by the 14th of august the company was well into the training 
 in suffield with a few days to shake out and to get accustomed to the vivid realism of the 360 
 templates after each platoon had a chance to get lost at least once the company joined the scots guards and 
 proceeded to combat the stubborn fantasian enemy following several days of advancing and skirmishing the soldiers began the first of 
 several opportunities to dig in many sighs of relief were breathed when cpl turner appeared with his dozer to give 
 the soldiers a hand with the excavation into the suffield sands after a hard week of being hounded the fantasians 
 launched a spirited counter attack which was thwarted by the patricias holding the key position in the line a mopping 
 up exercise completed the training and the fantasians were driven from blue pond once again in addtion to the hard 
 work and long hours the soldiers had ample opportunity to meet their counterparts and exchange war stories and military kit 
 the training was an extremely realistic and valuable experience the scots went home very impressed with the high degree of 
 professionalism displayed by our soldiers and with the exception of the tankers becoming a nervous lotworrying 0:lot 0:worrying about being

 6 military tabloid sports day on 23rd september 1977 companies marched briskly onto rifles field to form a hollow square 
 upon his arrival the co lcol mackenzie told us to get at it and enjoy ourselves it was a fun 
 orientated day involving sports events with military application these included pushball trailer races tug of war grenade throwing stretcher relay 
 jerry can races and a crosscountry 0:cross 0:country race pushball was one of the more popular and certainly more humourous 
 events as bodies could be seen on the ball and field alike at times during the trailer race event it 
 was felt that if c company kept up the fast pace they would permanently find themselves at work within adm 
 company doing trailer loading work to top all events we held a command relay race if you had seen it 
 you would have said command what command what race all in all once the sun had set and rifles field 
 had been deserted everyone had to admit that it was a sports day worth remembering particularly for combat support company 
 as they had won the competition friday the 23rd sept 77 found b and c company teams deciding which way 
 to move the 6 ft diameter push ball during one of the military tabloid sports events ski school one of 
 the most successful ski schools ever organized by 1 ppcli was conducted throughout the month of january 1978 an elite

 gave us snow snow snow lots of sun and good skiing combined with superb accommodation and cooking made for an 
 outstanding ski school california exchange in february 1978 we participated in an exchange of troops which saw a platoon of 
 ours go to fort ord california while a platoon from the 3rd battalion 17th infantry 7th us infantry division came 
 to calgary the us platoon was greeted upon arrival by nippy 3o c weather their training in calgary and wainwright 
 consisted of weapons familiarization general briefings including some topics on cyprus a winter warfare indoctrination and a familiarization of canadian 
 winter sports we think they enjoyed themselves at least that s what their platoon commander 2 lt bob ferrard said

 which administratively began as early as september 1977 it was not however until january 1978 when the pace of preparation 
 quickened for at that time our recce party went to cyprus detailed training at the individual level started once the 
 battalion reorganization had taken place on 3rd march 78 the cyprus configuration saw a company commanded by major jurek b 
 company commanded by major grimshaw headquarters company commanded by captain newman logistics company commanded by major dehnke and rear party 
 commanded 0:com 0:manded by major crabbe a and b companies were to be responsible for manning the line shortly after 
 reorganizing we launched into exercise green line which closely simulated our peacekeeping job in cyprus it proved to be an 
 excellent exercise which gave our soldiers a great deal of insight into the nature of their jobs after what seemed 
 an all too short leave the advance party departed calgary on 22 march 1978 and was followed up during the 
 first week of april by the main body 1 ppcli had now begun its united nations tour of duty and

 primary role of adding realism to the annual waincon while employed as the enemy force against 1 cbg units prior 
 to waincon the platoon participated on ex prairie harvest and put on a demonstration for mgen neatby deputy commander of 
 mobile command while in wainwright the platoon was looked after by the 3rd battalion and with the exception of a 
 shortage of peanut butter was treated very well indeed many thanks to the third and especially to a coy for 
 their excellent hospitality the fantasian platoon was joined in wainwright by a tow section commanded by mcpl sarahs unfortunately or

 21 the second battalion lieutenant b n hall this past year has been a busy one indeed for second battalion 
 we kicked the year off in september of 77 with a major reshuffle of personnel within the battalion it took 
 everyone about a week to sort themselves out but once done we started to prepare for our first major defensive 
 exercise rampant charger as with the rest of the brigade all our training was geared towards the defensive phase of 
 war not only did we stress section platoon company and battalion drills but personal defensive standard operating procedures were efficiently 
 developed for example many junior officers developed shaft evading techniques as their personal defensive sop for garrison work this was 
 extremely useful as field officers are known for their efficiency in hunting down the unwary having learnt many useful drills 
 and renewed old skills during rampant charger the battalion started to prepare for two winter exercises in cfb shilo exercises 
 polar and silver fox for a while we were worried that we might have to simulate snow but true to 
 form it started snowing when we arrived it was a good exercise with a lot of people enjoying their first 
 winter swan our only major incident was the fire in the battalion safety nco s tent but since he was 
 out making sure everyone was observing fire orders no one was hurt christmas was a welcome break but we jumped 
 back into the routine with both feet to prepare for our winter test exercise rapier thrust once again the fantasian 
 hordes were vanquished by the battalion with the help of sound tactical principles leadership and a secret weapon anyone interested 
 in the secret weapon can send 25 cents and one cover from cfp 309 3 continued support for another year 
 as well somewhere in north norway a group of patricias on exercise brass ensemble with a few invited guests and 
 one vaguely familiar politician hoisted a few to celebrate regimental day in march the officers decided to beat the sr 
 nco s in a hockey game it was an easy 9 6 win with the officers barely sweating as the 
 nco s were helped or carried off the ice as a breather between exercises the battalion decided to put on 
 a bit of a show for kapyong 78 we spent a week rehearsing and drilling and put on a good 
 show for the first official visit to the battalion by major general g g brown and his wife pauline that 
 weekend also coincided with the graduation of two tq3 platoons who had completed their last 8 weeks of training at 
 winnipeg and shilo we capped the week end off with a memorial parade and service at the provincial war memorial 
 in winnipeg it is also a pleasure to note that two distinguished gentlemen lieutenant general w k carr and the 
 lieutenant governor of manitoba the honourable francis laurence jobin were invested as honorary patricias in the regiment 2 ppcli then 
 produced another best seller the little red book last year our little green book was a smash hit and this 
 one looks like another winner we can hardly wait for the little black book who knows what it will be 
 about then it was may the sun turned warm the flowers bloomed and the city was an excellent place to 
 be in so we went to wainwright this year the battalion participated in a small unit exchange program with coy 
 a 2 39 inf div from fort lewis washington our b company was sent down to the states while coy 
 a 2 39 joined us in wainwright the february march period was spent on primary combat function pcf course training 
 the usual courses were run but with the addition of a basic sniper course the sports program also continued at 
 a hectic pace hockey and volleyball in particular were of a very high calibre a company winning hockey and b 
 company winning volleyball march 17th was celebrated in both the traditional and unusual way the officers allowed the sr nco 
 s to win again this year at broom i loo thus assuring their needless to say waincon 78 was very 
 interesting for weeks we trained in order to be able to beat the fantasians once again despite their propaganda we 
 remained firm in our loyalty to canada and to 1 cbg only to discover at the last minute that we 
 were going to be the fantasians so with a shrug and lots of red tape we converted we also practiced

 39 the third battalion captain r e thompson ex raw quarter late november through early december 1977 saw the deployment 
 0:deploy 0:ment of approximately 140 men of a company and recce platoon to cfb shilo for exercise raw quarter while 
 in the main camp at shilo a company was quartered in the regional early warning centre better known as the 
 hole which serves as a sheltered hq centre for the manitoba government 0:govern 0:ment should the need ever arise a 
 company spent the first week working on a gradual acclimatization 0:acclimatiza 0:tion to the cold and then as enemy force 
 for 2 ppcli in preparation for exercise rapier thrust 78 the exercise was good experience for the many soldiers new 
 to the battalion and to winter operations by the end of the exercise they were looking forward to the re 
 acclimatizaion that would take place on return to victoria exercise rapier thrust vi was soon to follow getting ready to 
 depart 
 40 exercise rapier thrust vi in january 1978 3 ppcli less b company was developed to cfb shilo to play 
 enemy force for 1 canadian brigade group the primary job of a company and recce platoon was to test the 
 defensive capabilities of 2nd battalion there was an additional foe considerably more awesome and overpowering than 2 ppcli the weather 
 as a winter exercise it never let us down in the least it was never warmer than 30 c and 
 the howling winds reminded us of something we might see on national geographic back in victoria the highlights of the 
 exercise were many and nearly always exciting or amusing or cold or ridiculous like the time maj manning s tent 
 collapsed in the snow storm at 3 o clock in the morning talk about a concerned look the platoons were 
 not without their follies either like 2 platoon 0:pla 0:toon while guiding the company to a demonstration attack for the 
 umpires took it upon itself to get the company totally disoriented lost needless to say the airways were pretty hot 
 for a few minutes a lot of one niner out a company and recce platoon did however do some good 
 professional soldiering nearly all the attacks by a company were seen to be successful by brigade headquarters recce platoon commanded 
 by lt palhazi spent many long and tedious hours being enemy for a company and in conducting 0:conduc 0:ting reconnaissance 
 for a company to its objectives 3 platoon was alert and ready at all times they captured two enemy patrols 
 near an a company leaguer on a hot tip from pte ripley but then again they lost a section the 
 next night a company s transport nco sgt murphy and his mechanics spent the whole exercise working very hard to 
 keep a company mobile of course the company was well administered 0:ad 0:ministered by capt millward csm miller and wo 
 widenmaier in order that the good and the bad guys not get too far out of hand 3 ppcli conducted

 42 patricia s academic and technical training scheme 1978 patts also in january 1978 the battalion launched an academic and 
 technical training scheme which was tailored to the soldier s availability and time off here at work point barracks the 
 scheme was organized by maj smith in consultation with camosun college victoria the training took place each tuesday and thursday 
 when the battalion was in garrison the scheme s concept was ideal since it allowed the men to take courses 
 which they normally would not have been able to because of the great amount of time away from the garrison 
 the courses offered this year included general grade 12 equivalency auto mechanics welding woodworking and cooking the soldiers paid an 
 initial fee for books and instruction by qualified instructors and were reimbursed on their successful completion of the courses let

 43 entertaining the handicapped before disappearing on christmas and new year s leave and before any real celebrations started 3 
 ppcli carried out a most noteworthy community activity the battalion hosted the children of the pearkes clinic for handicapped children 
 at a christmas party to ensure that some of the less fortunate were not forgotten during this special part of 
 the year santa claus his elves and 15 hosts supplied with lots of goodies entertained the children the christmas party 
 was a complete success and every child certainly had a good time and was most impressed that santa cpl houghton 
 seemed particularly interested in each and every request he made an excellent puppet show was presented and some christmas films 
 were shown to round out the entertainment the children were happy to learn that someone cared 
 44 men s christmas dinner on thursday december 22nd all ranks were mustered in the men s kitchen for the 
 christmas dinner this was the first indication that the festive season had arrived since only one snowfall had occurred in 
 victoria up until this time the dinner organized by wo weber was excellent the co and the youngest soldier carved 
 the turkey while the officers warrant officers and senior ncos served the men some sports trophies and cds were presented

 47 exercise saturn ramble third battalion participated in exercise saturn ramble from march 10th to 22nd at fort lewis and 
 yakima in washington state the aim of the exercise was to do our annual qualification on the rifle and machine 
 gun and to exercise the battalion s subunits 0:sub 0:units in defence and patrolling the week on the ranges went 
 reasonably well fort lewis boasts 115 ranges of various descriptions and needless to say such a plethora of facilities offered 
 unlimited opportunity to fire our weapons three days were spent classifying on the fnci rifle with mcpl bourne taking top 
 honours scoring 74 out of a possible 81 the dco topped the officers with a 71 despite his v 4 
 some soldiers had to take the test a second time before qualifying but there was a relatively high percentage of 
 marksmen in the battalion practices were held to qualify the light automatic riflemen and sub machine gunners one of the 
 more interesting aspects of the weeks activities was the time spent on the mechanical target ranges range 79 was especially 
 useful because each hit was electronically recorded by a computer consequently the total number of hits could be counted and 
 the best section determined competitions were held at night with the aid of the image intensifying starlight scope in terms 
 of accuracy and fire control mcpi moon s number 4 section won the night shoot while mcpl bunzenmeyer s 0:bunzen 
 0:meyer 0:s number 5 section topped the daylight competition as the week neared completion things began to gear up for 
 the regimental day celebrations on march 17th ppcli was sixty four years old but due to training commitments the occasion 
 was celebrated a day early the afternoon was devoted to sports and the evening to a mess dinner with our 
 american hosts from the 2nd battalion of the 39th infantry with some able coaching and managing from last year s 
 queen pte grant won the chariot queen contest despite valiant efforts however his charioteers could only manage a fourth place 
 finish in the chariot race which was won by a company this setback was immediately rectified by the b company 
 tug of war squad under the able direction of sgt gosse they pulled their way to victory shortly thereafter csm 
 shultz of headquarters company managed to fit fifty eight wriggling bodies including the co and the rsm into the back 
 of a 5 4 ton truck this effort was good enough for a first place finish meanwhile in the broom 
 i 100 competition a last minute goal by re newf greeley and shut out goaltending by cpl mo moiseyev gave 
 b company the title in that sport finally a combined effort led b company to victory in the chain of 
 command race by the end of the afternoon b company found itself the overall winners of the sports day for 
 the second year in a row to the satisfaction of major mcmurray the third battalion celebrates regimental day at fort 
 lewis washington the chain ot command race is always interesting 
 48 fun and games over with it was time to get back to some serious soldiering yakima presented new problems 
 in camouflage and concealment the only vegetation in yakima was a type of sage brush that failed to hide such 
 pieces of military kit as vehicles hoochies bodies or trenches to further complicate matters the digging was extremely difficult and 
 this slowed down the development of defensive positions nevertheless the troops buckled down to the task at hand and worked 
 extremely hard to make their positions defensible before the expected enemy onslaught materialized for the next three nights the troops 
 used pick and shovel to good effect and finally had positions that if not perfect were at least capable of 
 resisting enemy attack in the meantime different platoons had been assigned all the various tasks that are part of defensive 
 operations minefields had been laid each night and barbed wire entanglements had been constructed as well patrols had been sent 
 out to destroy enemy positions and to ambush enemy recce parties as the culminating battle approached the defenders were as 
 ready as they could be given the time available at first light a company rose out of the sagebrush to 
 attack b company in a spirited battle amid swirling smoke and small arms fire both sides were severely mauled some 
 troops had to be rescued by the umpires from an even more severe mauling as individual skirmishes broke out in 
 the trenches after a hearty steak dinner a beer and a good nights sleep in yakima the company departed for 
 victoria one last stop was needed at the border to buy a memento to mark the end of exercise saturn

 49 c company resurrected c company got off the ground in fine style the night of march 19th as otd 
 serial 7715 gothic line arrived at work point barracks and took up residence in their new quarters amid wonderous stares 
 the 32 new membes of 3 ppcli s newest company moved into building 1075 an austere brick building dating back 
 to the early 1900 s being such rudimentary quarters it was decided not to have the platoon spend too much 
 time inside so at 0800 hours the next day the group was out pounding the roads of esquimalt on their 
 first of their many road runs major plouffe oc c company was pleased to see the ranks finally filling up 
 and preparing for waincon 78 platoon indoctrination steadily progressed under the watchful eyes of 2 lt mcdonough and mcpls griffith 
 comeau and kennedy valuable guidance was always available from company 2ic capt wild and ever present company sergeant major reed 
 having settled into garrison routine it was time for a change so after a relaxing four day easter break the 
 platoon was packed and sent off for three days training at mary hill their departure arrived none too soon for 
 quick on their heels came a second platoon from wainwright another informative in routine was conducted under the direction of

 the past year has been a demanding one for patricias serving in the canadian airborne regiment the move from edmonton 
 to petawawa was completed by august and with the move there were several personnel and organizational changes col j j 
 painchaud r22er took command of the regiment and l col r m dick macintosh was appointed deputy commander their concerted 
 efforts ensured that the regiment regained its operational efficiency in a very short period of time accommodation at cfb petawawa 
 was limited working under a formation headquarters was a change after years of independence in edmonton notwithstanding 0:notwith 0:standing these 
 initial difficulties the regiment was able to commence its training programme at company level by october exercises d and e 
 companies conducted platoon and company training in borden and meaford in october these exercises provided a good base for the 
 first commando level exercise in borden in january 78 during the same period f company was deployed as an enemy

 role under the capable leadership of capt r a rags duncan and assisted by mwo b e reed f company

 boersma at the rear after a short stay in garrison the regiment started its preparation for exercise regal onager this 
 exercise was designed primarily to practise the regiment s quick rig procedures these procedures had to be changed considerably since 
 our days in edmonton with trenton as the staging base being approximately four hours away by road timings and procedures 
 developed in edmonton no longer applied in addition various details had to be worked out with the staff at cfb 
 trenton to accommodate the regiment prior to its deployment and to provide facilities for normal battle procedures to this end 
 the exercise proved very useful in correcting some of the inherent problems shown above during exercise regal onager are left

 million on world wide television during the opening ceremonies of the commonwealth games at edmonton we have said farewell to 
 several of our musicians whose musical talents and abilities as performers will be difficult to replace and we have welcomed 
 their replacements we find it increasingly difficult to say goodbye to our old friends particularly those who retire just when 
 their musical careers are reaching their peak the enthusiasm and willingness of the young will have to compensate for experience 
 for at least a few years maybe quite a few in any event those posted out or retiring included capt

 83 canadian forces recruit school captain e f parker regimental representation at cfrs has increased quite a bit over the 
 past tew years to the point where one can now say that the patricias make a significant impact on the 
 basic training of all new servicemen with the emergence of regimental accoutrements 0:accoutre 0:ments last year it is safe to 
 say that we ve added a noticeable bit of colour to what had previously been the domain of that other 
 english speaking regiment the first thing you notice about being posted to cornwallis is the amount of time you don 
 t spend away from home to the uninitiated it might seem that a posting to cfrs is something of a 
 swan on the one hand that s an accurate description as it gives you a chance to relax from the 
 fast pace of battalion life on the other hand however you quickly find yourself with much more responsibility than you 
 ever had in a battalion it is not unusual to find a master corporal commanding a section of 20 or 
 30 brand new recruits or a warrant officer with a platoon of 130 all ranks the first few weeks of 
 every course finds the squad instructors in the barracks every night in order to turn civilians into soldiers in just 
 11 short weeks no easy task in keeping with tradition sgt anderson wo ellis capt parker sgt tessier and sgt 
 rushworth regimentally speaking the highlight of the past year at cfrs was the celebration of our regimental day on march 
 17th guest of honour for the occasion was lcol r t maceachern commandant of cfrs who paid tribute to the 
 members of the regiment who have contributed to the success of recruit training lcol maceachern accepted on behalf of the 
 school a print of the battle of kapyong a gift from all the patricias serving at cfrs past present and 
 future other activities included the cutting of the regimental birthday cake by cwo mac lean an ex member of 3rd 
 battalion from korea days and mwo stever treating everyone to a showing of an old regimental trooping film it was 
 interesting to note that four of those present took part in or watched the actual trooping in 1953 maj jim

 hard work of their instructors to add a bit of flavour to the event sgt mole the platoon 21 c 
 modified his cf parade belt to the regimental pattern cutting the birthday cake wo ellis and cwo mac lean ex 
 3rd bn 1978 saw the inauguration of an important new step in the training of infantry recruits at cfrs for 
 the first time recruits destined for the infantry were grouped into regimentally affiliated courses commanded by regimental officers this trial 
 is part of an effort to produce regimental identity and esprit de corps among infantry recruits right from the start 
 and thus hopefully reducing culture shock and hence attrition during the next levels of training the first special patricia serial 
 was kapyong platoon which graduated on 30th june the platoon was commanded by lt eckley from 2 ppcli with mcpls

 85 the royal green jackets royal green jacket news 1977 1978 ist battalion the old slogan of join the army 
 and see the world may not be as true today as it used to be but footloose members of the 
 battalion can have few complaints of being too static during the last year the end of 1976 saw us returning 
 from a six month tour of cyprus the end of 1977 sees the forward elements of the battalion disappearing prior 
 to the move to hong kong in january in between much of the united kingdom has been visited including ulster 
 and london the main event of the year was almost inevitably the four month tour to belfast but before switching 
 our minds to the subtleties of urban guerrilla warfare the more conventional infantry skills had to be brushed up the 
 battalion took over north west belfast from 1 st devon and dorsets on may 21st the areas were diverse and 
 challenging and our predecessors left behind them an exceptionally high reputation the visit of her majesty the queen to the 
 province provided a natural focus for our tour coinciding with the anniversary of internment and the apprentice boys marches the 
 battalion s pre emptive move in blocking off all routes to the city centre whilst putting considerable extra strain on 
 the riflemen must have had some effect on the consequential failure of the provos to make it a grim visit 
 to remember trouble did flare predictably on the 9th of august and while a and c companies had minor rioting 
 in the ardoyne it was left to b and support companies to have the larger portion of the action with 
 a two day riot in the new lodge the highlight of the tour was the enormous numbers of weapons recovered 
 in our area a total of seventy four firearms support company under its master sniffer woii trower claimed the most 
 with the aid of the discovery of thirty rifles hidden in a derelict orange hall which were smuggled into ulster 
 by the uvf in 1912 despite these successes the battalion had to pay a heavy price on the 18th of 
 august lcpl marshall of the gordon highlanders was killed on patrol in ardoyne while assisting c company and three days 
 later on the 31st of august cpl william smith of the reconnaissance platoon was killed whilst on a mobile patrol 
 in the new lodge he was within three weeks of completing his sixth tour in the province his professionalism and 
 good humour will be sadly missed these two tragic incidents cloud the fact that for the first time the battalion 
 could notice a definite easing of tension and the first real signs of hope for a peaceful future during the 
 summer the shooting team performed again at sedsam and bisley where it achieved 11th position in the major units championships 
 and a second place in the section match individual performances of note came from cpl finn in winning the whitehead 
 and beating the queen s medallist on the second re shoot after two successive highest possible scores and from captain 
 hugh babbington smith rifleman frape and sgt crook in the army hundred it will be hard for the battalion to 
 qualify next year when faced with three gurkha shooting teams in hong kong but high hopes remain for a further 
 advance october saw the battalion return to dover and frantic efforts to retrain before the move to honng kong a 
 jr nco s and section commanders cadre was run along with signals anti tank and mortar cadres classification was shot 
 and fitness tests were taken when suddenly at three days notice b and c companies found themselves fighting fires in 
 south west london the original stations of hounslow and merton were soon expanded and additional 0:addi 0:tional stations were set 
 up at acton and mile end in the east end to achieve this a and support companies were asked to 
 provide the manpower and life at dover almost ground to a halt along with our neighbours renewing the happy rivalry 
 with 3 rgj we received the full glare of national publicity during the controversial firemen s strike however the plastics 
 factory where 1 rgj arrived after 3 rgj but managed to get their hoses going first is not we are 
 told going to appear on the cap badge despite all the interruptions the move to hong kong goes ahead and 
 within the space of a month the battalion will have downed hoses eaten christmas puddings and be exploring the delights 
 of the far east join the army and see the world 2nd battalion the 2nd battalion under the command of 
 the late lieutenant colonel lain corden lloyd obe mc enjoyed an active 1977 gibraltar continued to provide the duties associated 
 with a semi tropical overseas posting under seige conditions the governor s guard mounted ceremonially continued to draw large crowds 
 every 
 86 monday at 1030 because of the impressive whiskers of the bugle major the pace of the band and the 
 immaculate light infantry drill guaranteed to raise approving applause ceremonial continued to play an important part in our lives especially 
 during the jubilee celebrations we provided a massive guard of 144 men under the command of major shane hearn for 
 the jubilee parade which stole the show on a beautiful warm clear june day the double past was so impressive 
 that we managed a standing ovation and thunderous applause from a very cosmopolitan 0:cos 0:mopolitan audience perhaps our most enjoyable 
 weekend during our 2 years and 2 months came right at the very end when we were required to break 
 a dock strike by unloading an lsl and re loading it with our own kit enthusiasm knows no bounds when 
 riflemen are asked to pile other people s boxes on flimsy wires hauled by weak cranes and drive fork lift 
 trucks into and under anything resembling a box the ship was turned round in 36 hours a job which would 
 have taken a week using the usual labour force our cooperation with the other services continued heartily be it our 
 dog section under lcpl hunt at raf north front or our visit to the naval ships which frequented gibraltar again 
 this year we dispatched parties to alexandria cyprus italy france morocco and malta with the senior service but perhaps the 
 most entertaining visit was that of our affiliated ship the lovely hms alacrity newest and smartest ship in the royal 
 navy the battalion left gibraltar with mixed feelings in september but happy to return to green fields and fresh milk 
 the wonders of civilization this time we are in mooltan barracks tidworth which has seen green jackets before our noses 
 are buried deep into all aspects of training as we prepare for our 4 month visit to south armagh in 
 december 3rd battalion october 1977 found the battalion well entrenched in a major european city carrying out in their turn 
 routine duties that is as far as the similarity to berlin goes for we are out of berlin s cocoon 
 of luxury and unreality and happy with our feet firmly planted on english soil in the autumn of last year 
 tedious garrison duties of dubious relevance were spiced with thoughts of and training for a four month tour in south 
 armagh in the following spring a hectic fortnight was spent at sennelager during november driving and coaxing the berlin riddled 
 riflemen to a reawakened awareness of operation banner soldiering the rest of the year was spent at a disconcertingly rigorous 
 pace apart from routine duties and trying to move to caterham the battalion underwent its fitness for role assessment and 
 a series of tests of individual standards while the move to caterham and disembarkation leave was being taken green jacket 
 skiers were competing high in the remote vastness of austrian and bavarian valleys the downhill team had some notable individual 
 successes and dominated the downhill events in the face of some frightening conditions this put four skiers in the army 
 team however they lacked consistency as a team and so did not realise their full potential the battalion also raced 
 a young cross country ski team made up of skiers raised at the depot the competition was tough and the 
 team inexperienced but valuable lessons were learned the year was soon off to a brisk start with training at the 
 cinque ports training area to meet our northern ireland shadow reinforcement commitment it was difficult to take the likelihood of 
 deployment to ulster seriously as the province was quiet and anyway we would be going in second to the spearhead 
 battalion however mr paisley bellowed and a protestant strike was imminent a very frustrating three and a half weeks were 
 spent in east belfast the strike never gathered momentum and consequently nor did we as there was little to deal 
 with we waited we wondered whether we would be able to go to canada what we did not quite understand 
 was that being part of london district gives a very different dimension to priorities we were already in the programme 
 for lining the strand on jubilee day so back home we were to come the contingent of 8 officers and 
 160 other ranks paraded in greens and looked very fine the saga of finding greens and then bodies to fit 
 them still brings a wry smile to the face of the quartermaster it seemed that mr average had to be 
 5 feet 8 inches with a 38 inch waist in the evening the band bugles took part in a programme 
 specially for jubilee day their performance was brilliant and its effervescence 0:effer 0:vescence delighted the audience the band was left 
 in england to continue a heavy programme of pageants shows and carnivals while the battalion flew out to canada the 
 destination was wainwright alberta into the bush disappeared unmolested each company to its tented camp for ten days of its 
 own training they came together for the battalion exercise and then for a few days leave during which a visit 
 to the calgary stampede was laid on after the leave the rifle company rotated through field firing the tarleton inter 
 platoon competition and an adventure training camp 400 miles away up in the rockies support company returned from canada early 
 to start preparing for the queen s and tower of london guards and were hard at it under the watchful 
 eye of woi walker s guards team while the rest of the battalion enjoyed leave 5 former members of c 
 company were present including one of its platoon commanders now brigadier david stileman riflemen s response to public duties has 
 been typical of them in many ways being natural performers the full houses at the railings of buckingham palace and 
 in the tower of london have provided the incentive the scintillating marching pace slick movements and lesser stature have been 
 a sharp contrast to the stately if cumbersome guards guardsmen are reported not to enjoy the fiendish pace at which 
 some of them have been marched to st jamess palace sweat swarming down their reddened blowing cheeks from under their 
 bearskins with public duties in full swing and the battalion surprised at how smart it can get itself attention is 
 now being focused on the move to and our role in londonderry 4th volunteer battalion october was a comparatively quiet 
 month punctuated by a few high points possibly the highest point was the battalion exercise which took place on salisbury 
 plain on 22 23 october for the first time in the cynic s recent memory the promised helicopters appeared and 
 three of the five companies made good use of them each company advanced withdrew patrolled and dug in and after 
 a tiring 36 hours it was only the very fittest who seemed disappointed when the exercise ended it was a 
 great success and the attendance was encouragingly high in view of the fact that it had poured with rain in 
 london oxford and aylesbury on the friday before the exercise started next month is an adjutant s and rsm s 
 nightmare with the lord mayor s show and remembrance sunday commitments boots are being bulled service dresses pressed and hair 
 surely not being cut with an enthusiasm unseen since at least this time last year the rifle depot the highlight 
 of the year was training company s success by a large margin in the south east district patrol competition all 
 training establishments in the district entered teams and competition 0:competi 0:tion was intense the competition was in three phases a 
 night patrol a seven mile timed march and finally a shoot the team from 6 platoon commanded by cpl george 
 newman won by a substantial margin which was enhanced by their scoring twice as many points in the patrol phase 
 as the majority of the other teams 
 87 junior riflemen s company have again been able to train all over the country and overseas the central theme 
 of the juniors training has remained motivation towards a military career the juniors spend three terms in the company and 
 their programme is split between military training education and adventure training the culmination of both adventure and military training was 
 carried out in canada the two senior platoons under lts richard carrow and nigel atkinson and company headquarters were extremely 
 fortunate to be invited by the 3rd battalion to join them on exercise pond jump west in all 70 members 
 of the company spent the whole of july based at camp wainwright in alberta memories of this trip varied from 
 the sun drenched heat and mosquitoes of wainwright to the sudden snowfalls on the mountain base camp and the excitement 
 of the calgary stampede the highlight of the military training was the opportunity for charles vyvyan the company commander to 
 deploy his company as enemy to the 3rd battalion on their battalion exercise the company s adventure training instructors under 
 captain nicholas cottam formed the nucleous of a joint camp with the 3rd battalion established in the rockies the most 
 notable achievement was the ascent of mount mackenzie 9 900 feet all juniors are encouraged to take up an adventure 
 training pursuit during the first term this year water skiing and paraascending 0:para 0:ascending have been added to the activities 
 already carried out sub aqua climbing canoeing and trekking camps have been arranged as far afield as skye alderney snowdonia 
 dartmoor and the ski hut at steibis in bavaria for the depot itself 1977 has been an extremely full year 
 to mark the queens silver jubilee this year s sounding retreat was enlarged to include a musical pageant in place 
 of the band concert the pageant was colonel charles simmons idea and after some thought it was decided that the 
 theme should be the history of the site of peninsula barracks through the ages throughout the spring major john hind 
 the quartermaster tackled the problem of building a castle then destroying it building a palace in its place and then 
 burning it and finally building long block all in the space of 30 minutes the pageant was followed by the 
 retreat which was as always most impressive we were delighted to welcome the pipes and drums of the 6th queen 
 elizabeth s own gurkha rifles who joined with the band and bugles of the ist and 3rd battalions and our 
 junior band and bugles in a departure from the normal format the retreat was staged on two nights we played 
 to packed audiences on both nights and because of the increased popularity we shall stage the retreat twice next year 
 when the performances will take place on friday 14 and saturday 15 july in the military field the highlight of 
 the year was the depots success at bisley where we won both the minor units and the junior minor units

 brigade at bien hoa in 1965 national service was introduced and a task force was committed to south vietnam it 
 was during this commitment to south vietnam that the royal australian regiment was increased in size from four to nine

 at the australian land warfare centre at canungra southwest of brisbane and at enoggera auscan 77 an equivalent contingent from 
 the third battalion royal australian regiment rar trained in canada the rar contingent arrived on august 6th and trained for 
 six weeks in several areas of british columbia alberta the yukon and in the north west territories the rar contingent 
 training consisted of a familiarization with canada an introduction to united nations peacekeeping mountain warfare riverine operations and a northern 
 exercise the rar contingent arrived in victoria from australia to be met by 50 hosts of 3 ppcli who had 
 just completed an advanced mountaineering course in preparation for their guests august 6th was a warm day so a good 
 supply of cold beer was on hand for our thirsty guests major mike barret said i am looking forward to 
 the training and especially to a visit with colonel jim stone as 3 rar was at kapyong in korea in 
 1950 when 2 ppcli won the presidential citation with the familiarization of canada completed in the first week which allows 
 3 rar to overcome the jet lag and the flu which hit about one third of the contingent it was 
 time for four weeks of training it was bear against machine and the bear won on exercise arctic odyssey some 
 australian soldiers in an apc at churchill on the tundra near hudson bay saw a polar bear in the distance 
 and chased after it for a better look they were busily taking photographs when the bear decided enough was enough 
 and turned towards the apc the advice of the third battalion crew was almost superfluous and there was a scramble 
 to climb aboard the apc backed off smartly an angry polar bear in the troop compartment would not have been 
 a joke this was just one of the incidents australian soldiers reported after they returned from a week long visit 
 to communities in the yukon the north west territories and in the hudson bay areas the third battalion royal austrailian 
 regiment visiting and working a highlite of the tour had to be a visit by a the contingent was split 
 into six patrols and each lived in the community to experience the life style and environment of canada s far 
 north each community had its own special significance in dawson city scene of the great gold rush just before the 
 turn of the century the diggers saw something of the life in the goldfields as it was then the soldiers 
 were able to try their hand at gold panning on the bonanza like the miners of yesteryear most of their 
 poke went to the tables at diamond tooth gertie s gambling saloon at mayo when the soldiers finished their panning 
 at a local gold mine moose steak was on the menu the menu was a little more familiar when they 
 visited the keno silver mine the management flew in australian lamb chops especially for them some soldiers were able to 
 sample life in the arctic when they visited cambridge bay inside the arctic circle there as in other communities they 
 met the local inuit while the group at rankin inlet watched 81 year old sculptor john kavik whose work is 
 becoming world famous at work then in the third week the diggers became climbers some 150 kilometers southwest of calgary 
 in the rocky mountains they camped near the upper and lower kananaskis lakes it snowed on the day they arrived 
 not being familiar with the fluffy stuff did not hinder their behaviour at all they formed two lines and facing 
 each other had a snowball fight by the time they left they had walked the kananaskis pass through the mountains 
 to the kootenay river in british columbia there they took part in a river operation the training included mountain walking 
 rock climbing rappelling first aid and casualty evacuation on mount invincible the men took part in a 30 hour exercise 
 during which they experienced working at high altitudes none of the exercises were inherently dangerous but there was an element 
 of danger in them all at the end of this training the soldiers received specialty qualifications in basic mountaineering and 
 had enjoyed a week of excellent and exciting training most welcome friend colonel big jim stone dso mc cd 
 95 exchange training with 112 th jager battalion captain o w lovell on may 24th 1978 nine patricias left cfb

 foot in lahr a busy schedule awaited them after a lunch in the europahoff the group was met by their 
 german hosts under the direction of ober lieutenant herbert kriebel who had visited 1 ppcli in january for ski training 
 in banff we left by bus for the battalion s home at regen enroute to regen in south east germany 
 we would see some of the most beautiful scenery of the bavarian forest and bodensee lake of constance the trip 
 was broken by a 24 hour stopover at munich where we toured the deutsche museum the city centre and the 
 1972 olympic stadium an evening at the famous haufbrahaus introduced 0:intro 0:duced us to the one litre beer steins regen 
 is a quiet and attractive village situated on the edge of the bavarian forest the 112 th jager battalion occupies 
 a modern and impressive barracks located on the outskirts of regen we were met the first day by the dco 
 major pilz and we spent the day with familiarization tours of the battalion the official greeting came the next day 
 when the commanding officer lcol speidel welcomed our group and expressed his particular enthusiasm that we would be training with 
 his soldiers at hammelburg but hammelburg was a week away and in the interim we would conduct a whirlwind of 
 activities some of the events included firing the rifle the uzzi sub machine gun a helicopter recce of the bavarian 
 forest battalion mortar demonstration city of regen reception and tours of the czechoslovakian border the castle of wiesenstein and the 
 city of passau passau was a memorable city situtated at the junction of the inn llz and danube rivers in 
 regen we also competed in the annual german infantry efficiency test this test involved classification on the g 3 rifle 
 several track events such as the 100 m dash the long jump and the shot put and a 5 000 
 m run the second portion of the test was done in hammelburg and consisted of a 25 km march followed 
 by a 200 m timed swim when the final scores for the efficiency test were tallied we had all earned 
 the prized leistungen badge at one of the three levels 3 bronze 5 silver and 4 geld re sim had 
 a record breaking 5 000 metre run time of 166 minutes 57 seconds the weekend before we left for hammelburg 
 was spent in the company of several battalion members or in travel around southern germany one of us made it 
 as far south as geneva in hammelburg we got down to some serious infantry soldiering the first week was spent 
 under the instruction of the infantry school staff along with battalion officers and defensive operations in built up areas during 
 the second week the battalion main body arrived and commenced training progressing from section level to a final twenty hour 
 battalion exercise that s not to say all of our time was spent in the boonies we did manage to 
 find time for a few curry wurst in the local town a weekend in wurzburg including tours to rottenburg on 
 the taber and the wine cellars at volkach and a border politzei tour of the east german frontier near rasdorf 
 to end off a perfect exchange the co lcol speidel hosted the patricia group to a wine cellar dinner in 
 the town of hammelburg the next morning at a battalion parade we received 112 th jager lapel pins and became 
 honorary jagers with many fond memories we departed by bus for lahr on the first leg of the return trip

 96 the patricia s at bisley by captain d s ethell cd in 1978 for the first time in fourteen 
 years ppcli was the canadian forces representative at the annual bisley rifle competition in england a team doesn t just 
 go to bisley it is a long slow process of competitions at battalion brigade and national level and final selection 
 before the team boards the plane for the uk bisley is the mecca for shooters from throughout the commonwealth plus 
 other invited countries there were more than 2000 shooters in the camp with more than 300 shooting on one range 
 at one time bisley is the culmination of more than a year s preparation by both the shooters and the 
 staff this is the story of the third battalion team the team went to the brigade shoot in calgary in 
 june of 1977 with a team that had been practicing under the expert coaching of sgt ted luscombe and captain 
 don pippolo after a hardfought 0:hard 0:fought battle with second battalion 3 ppcli won the ram s head symbolic of 
 the brigade championship immediately following the brigade shoot it was decided by the regiment and the brigade that a strong 
 team would represent 1 cbg at the canadian forces small arms competition at connaught in august 1977 such a team 
 would be based on 3 ppcli the following were selected to represent the regimeht at connaught and subsequently at bisley

 five days of hard shooting at connaught it became apparent that the patricia team would win the letson and vanier 
 trophies and move on to bisley in addition sgt luscombe was to win the coveted queen s medal with 2nd 
 and 3rd position being occupied by cpl lauritsen and sgt smith respectively after the excitement of connaught it was time 
 to settle down and decide on the team and training required to do well at bisley in july 1978 right 
 after the new year 3 ppcli commenced indoor practices at esquimau followed closely by 2 ppcli at kapyong barracks 2nd 
 battalion members soon moved out to victoria for training in the meantime the top three non ppcli shooters at connaught 
 were selected by ndhq and loaded onto the team these three all from 2 rcr were sgt surette jr mcpl 
 comeau r mcpl cunningham ka in may all elements concentrated in calgary to undergo intensive training as a team this 
 particular month was invaluable in that it established team homogenity and enabled all shooters to work on their particular weaknesses 
 the new cls were fired in and many many hours were spent on the ranges with words of wisdom offered 
 by the qmsi during this time the team proceeded to chilliwack for the british columbia rifle association s service rifle 
 match where the c3s were fired in personal histories were written final fittings for regimental blazers and flannels were made 
 movement and baggage plans were finalized communications were established with cdls and monies were received finally the paul bunyans were 
 loaded shipped and the team sent home for a week s leave before departure for england on july 29th the 
 team adjutant capt don pippolo along with the ndhq opi capt larry filman had left for england tour days before 
 to make the necessary administrative arrangements for the team s arrival on the 29th the regular service flight moving across 
 the country picked up the team members the team spent the night at trenton and left the next evening for 
 the uk via ottawa where we picked up all three 2 rcr members after an unscheduled stop at shearwater the 
 team was finally on its way to bisley it should be noted that in addition to the canadian forces team 
 there were two other canadian teams to compete at bisley both of these teams were on the same flight these 
 were the civilian team from the dominion of canada rifle association dcra and the canadian army cadet team upon arrival 
 at gatwick the three teams were met by capt pippolo and quickly loaded onto buses and transported the 35 miles 
 to bisley for those of us who had never been to england that ride was a novel experience the narrow 
 roads the crowds and of course the compulsory stop at an english pub bisley was new to most of us 
 however two of our number had been there before qmsl white was on his sixth trip and sgt luscombe was 
 making his second appearance these two members were the sources of information and guidance for all the uninitiated the quarters 
 traditionally allocated to the forces team f building in the council lines were occupied and our first meal was taken 
 in the dcra pavillion after two days of acclimatization unpacking and checking of weapons the team was able to get 
 on one of the many ranges at bisley the first week of competition is the british army championships 0:champion 0:ships 
 and here canada awards its own queen s medal the canadian army team cannot officially compete in this match but 
 the british army permitted the canadians to practice in all of the matches along with their own members this practice 
 was excellent and permitted the canadians to get accustomed to the idiosyncrasies of bisley and to the civilian range officers 
 bisley is an institution the buildings the ranges and the people the bisley competition is a set piece and would 
 require an act of parliament to change any aspect or people connected with it after the army championships and one 
 day of weapons maintenance 0:mainte 0:nance and laundry the service rifle matches of the british national rifle association took place 
 these four days were the main reason for all the time and effort the team had gone through to get 
 to bisley everything else was secondary the team started and ended with a bang the first competition the bisley bullet 
 was won by mcpl comeau and the second the sitting by qmsi white this was a tremendous start to a 
 series of triumphs by the shooters for the next three days the names of canadian soldiers continued to appear on 
 the winners and honours lists the end result was the best overall showing by any canadian army team in the 
 service rifle matches although the matches were generally oriented to the individual there was one team match which the team 
 had its eye on the united services match each of the eight teams entered their eight best shots for a 
 match involving four practises the canadians knew that they would do well and that their main competition would come from 
 the british army eight and the royal marines after the first practice the marines were leading with the canadians right 
 behind after the second and third practices the canadians were leading followed by the british army eight finally the british 
 eight won with a score of 1299 the canadians were second with 1295 followed by the marines with 1253 a 
 very close match which ended with a one bull difference to be so narrowly beaten by the british army eight 
 the best eight is nothing to be ashamed of once the service rifle was finished with re taylor ending up 
 as the top gun of the canadian team we competed in the target rifle matches with the c 3 sniper 
 rifles our lads performed very well with the qmsi winning two individual matches and sgt luscombe advancing to the final 
 stage of the queen s prize the best 100 shots out of 2000 it was a tremendous experience 
 97 for the shooters to be competing at world class level with shooters from throughout the empire and europe needless 
 to say there were the compulsory national receptions with many many momentos exchanged one of the highlights of the trip 
 was the visit to bisley of our colonel in chief after her trip to canada in july followed by a 
 visit to moscow she graciously consented to come to bisley for dinner and to meet her team it was a 
 magnificent occasion for the patricias to have lady patricia greet them in her home country after an excellent dinner she 
 spoke informally for 20 minutes telling her soldiers of her trip to the three battalions and her pleasure at finally 
 seeing patricias in england accompanying the colonel in chief were colonel and mrs leitch the colonelin chief s 0:colonel 0:in 
 0:chief 0:s visit will long be remembered by her bisley shootors at the end of more than three weeks of 
 intensive shooting it was finally time to come home once again the paul bunyons were loaded and shipped and the 
 bus arrived right on time for the trip back to gatwick the team flew to lahr for a brief stopover 
 before moving on to canada here we said goodbye to qmsi white and to sgt smith who continued on to 
 cyprus to finish the last three months of first battalion s tour in ottawa we said farewell to our rcr 
 friends and to three of our own who were staying for the national shoot at connaught the rest of the 
 team dropped off at winnipeg edmonton and vancouver the end of a year s hard work bisley 78 was an 
 experience that none of the team members will ever forget the shooters can be very proud that they shot second 
 to none and represented their country and regiment at a standard that had never been equalled the patricias had not 
 been to bisley for 14 years they will be well remembered for their 1978 appearance cf ppcli bisley team 1978

 98 pilgrimage to korea major h d p tighe mc cd retd last april i received a telephone call from 
 the regimental adjutant telling me that i had been selected together with warrant officers bill toews and doug preece to 
 represent ppcli on a visit to korea as part of a group organized by the department of veterans affairs to 
 participate in commemorative ceremonies to mark the 25th anniversary of the end of the 1950 53 korean war later i 
 received a letter from the colonel of the regiment confirming my selection i also heard from colonel jim stone to 
 whom i was second in command while with 2 bn ppcli in 1950 51 0:1950 0:51 and from lt col 
 larry gollner the commanding officer of 2 ppcli before leaving canada on this pilgrimage to korea i undertook to write 
 a report on my return and to include photographs taken by our official photographer bill olson who was also the 
 photographer with 2 ppcli in korea in 1950 51 i thought that the best way to report on this visit 
 would be to record the events as they occurred from day to day so this is the form this report 
 has taken i left ottawa on thursday morning july 20th by air canada and arrived in vancouver at about noon 
 pacific time and registered at the bayshore inn where we were all to assemble on thursday afternoon and friday morning 
 i renewed old friendships with those who had been in korea when i was there with 2 ppcli and also 
 got to know many of the other delegates who had served in korea at various times on friday morning july 
 21st we left for the vancouver airport and after a two hour delay because of generator problems we took off 
 on cp air s empress of japan for tokyo after crossing the international date line and after about nine hours 
 flying time we arrived at the new tokyo international airport narita at about 4 00 p m tokyo time on 
 saturday july 22nd we cleared customs and immigration left the airport and after a two hour bus ride arrived at 
 the tokyo prince hotel where i shared a room with colonel frank klenavic royal canadian regiment on sunday july 3rd 
 we were free to do as we wished tokyo on sunday is much the same as on a weekday the 
 large department stores are all open and crowded with shoppers who all seem very prosperous and eager to spend their 
 money some of us did shop but soon became aware of the very high prices so most of us exercised 
 caution and were very selective in any purchases we made on sunday evening the dva staff organized a most successful 
 birthday party for the minister i think it must have been one of those rare occasions when complete ministerial surprise 
 was achieved the party lasted well into the evening and was enjoyed by all on monday morning july 24th bill 
 toews doug preece and i met with bey hart of dva to plan the ceremony at the ppcli memorial at 
 naechon for friday july 28th we decided on a simple quiet and dignified ceremony the deputy minister of dva mr 
 w b brittain would begin the ceremony this would be followed by the chaplains memorial prayers i would then read 
 the act of remembrance especially written for this occasion by major jim macintosh formerly a private soldier with 1 ppcli 
 and now a major in the royal canadian chaplain corps i would be followed by general rockingham saying a few 
 words as our former brigade commander then there would be the last post the silence of remembrance the lament and 
 reveille three wreaths would then be laid one by the minister for canada one by general rockingham for the canadian 
 army and one by me accompanied by warrant toews and warrant preece for the regiment the ceremony would conclude with 
 a blessing by the chaplains at noon we had lunch shabu shabu japanese style at the mikasa kaikan restaurant located 
 in the ginza the shopping centre of tokyo we ate with chopsticks our group demonstrating varying degrees of skill and 
 some even resorting to asking for assistance from some of the japanese girls standing by ready to give help when 
 required in spite of the difficulties of crossing our relatively long legs under a low table and eating with chop 
 sticks we all enjoyed the good food later we returned to our hotel content and happy with the experience of 
 having had lunch in the traditional japanese fashion that evening we attended an official reception at the canadian embassy having 
 been invited by mr richard gorham the canadian charge d affaires in japan it was a pleasant gathering in the 
 beautiful surroundings of the ambassador s home and an elegant way to conclude the day s events on tuesday morning 
 july 25th we visited the yokohama british commonwealth war cemetery we first visited the world war ii plots for the 
 canadian dead of hong kong where special services were conducted and wreaths laid after these services were over we visited 
 the section of the yokohama cemetery known as the post war plot for the canadian dead of korea a similar 
 service was held here and wreaths were also laid after the services were over i noted that there were several 
 patricias buried here and i took pictures of their headstones after leaving the yokohama cemetery we drove to the yokohama 
 prince hotel located on a high hill overlooking yokohama harbour after lunch we drove to kamakura where we visited a 
 buddhist shrine there seems to be very little religious significance to this shrine now in the main it appears to 
 be a tourist attraction except for twice a year when the japanese people do visit once in december to ask 
 forgiveness for what they did wrong during the year and once in january to make requests for the coming year 
 afterwards we commenced a long slow bus ride through the heavy evening traffic back to the tokyo prince hotel where 
 we enjoyed a barbecue dinner in their garden restaurant after dinner bill olson and i went for a walk to 
 visit a nearby golf driving range which had once been a religious shrine it is a real commercial venture now 
 consisting of three covered elevations and tees for about 500 golfers and those who have ambitions of becoming golfers it 
 is all automated and is used both day and night the driving range extends for about 250 yards over valuable 
 tokyo real estate when we were there the range was almost completely covered with golf balls and bill olson said 
 it looked like a canadian football field covered in snow left to right major h d p tighe 2ic 2ppcli

 haneda airport until recently the main airport for tokyo here we left by japanese air lines for pusan via osaka 
 we landed at the kimhae airport near pusan at about 11 00 a m the korean army provided a guard 
 of honour for the minister and on leaving the airfield each of us was presented with a bouquet of flowers 
 we left the airport by bus and drove into pusan to the chosun beach hotel from the window in our 
 room we could see the waterfront and a long stretch of sandy beach the contrast from december 1950 when we 
 landed at pusan was tremendous in december 1950 we saw pusan in difficult times the war was going badly and 
 poverty and sickness seemed to be everywhere and the people seemed sad and confused today pusan is prosperous and the 
 people are happy the beach was crowded with people enjoying themselves on wednesday evening we attended our ministers official dinner 
 at which we met many korean civilian and military authorities the desire of the korean people to make korea a 
 united and prosperous country was reflected in our conversations with our guests during this dinner on thursday morning july 27th 
 we participated in the ceremony at the united nations memorial cemetery in pusan the canadian charge d affaires for korea 
 mr geoffrey charlebois opened the ceremonies and he was followed by our minister of veterans affairs then by a representative 
 of the republic of korea several wreaths were laid and i together with warrant doug preece laid one for the 
 regiment warrant bill toews was in uniform and was responsible for the lowering of the canadian flag for the last 
 post and raising it at the reveille once the ceremonies were completed i took photographs of many of the headstones 
 of our dead including that of rsm wood and of the plot near the flags where 36 members of 2 
 ppcli lay buried i then walked down towards the lower part of the cemetery where several more patricias are buried 
 unfortunately i did not have the time to photograph any more headstones as we were required to leave the cemetery 
 and return to the chosun beach hotel for lunch shortly after lunch we left in two military aircraft for seoul 
 at about 5 00 p m we arrived at our hotel the seoul plaza and that evening attended a reception 
 given by the korean veteran s association prior to the dinner we were presented with a medal together with a 
 certificate which read as follows ambassador for peace official proclamation name of the individual it is a great honor and 
 pleasure to express the everlasting 0:ever 0:lasting gratitude of the republic of korea and of our people for the service 
 you and your countrymen have performed in restoring and preserving our freedom and independence we cherish in our hearts the 
 memory of your boundless sacrifices in helping us re establish our free nation in grateful recognition of your dedicated contributions 
 it is my privilege to proclaim you an ambassador for peace with every good wish of the people of the 
 republic of korea let each of us reaffirm our mutual respect and friendship that they may endure for generations to 
 come maeng kee lee vice admiral rokn ret president the korean veterans association friday morning july 28th was a special 
 morning for ppcli as we were to visit our memorial at naechon not far from kapyong we left our hotel 
 in seoul and arrived at naechon at 11 00 a m and the ceremonies commenced the dm of veterans affairs 
 mr brittain made the opening remarks which were followed by the memorial prayers then i read the act of remembrance 
 as written by major jim macintosh act of remembrance by major jim macintosh read by major pat tighe formerly 2 
 ppcli as we stand before this ppcli memorial we remember all who have served their homeland in time of war 
 especially do we remember those who have given their lives in the service of their fellowmen who have paid the 
 supreme sacrifice that the world might be a better place in which to live with these thoughts our minds are 
 directed to the action of 2 ppcli in their struggle to hold open a withdrawal route through the kapyong valley 
 we remember with a deep sense of loss and yet with a deep sense of gratitude the ten members of 
 the patricias who gave their lives during that action they shall grow not old as we that are left grow 
 old age shall not weary them nor the years condemn at the going down of the sun and in the 
 morning we will remember them this act of remembrance was followed by a few words from general rockingham who said 
 it is a great honour for me to asist in honouring the dead of 2 ppcli who were part of 
 my brigade in korea although at the time of the action at kapyong on 23 25 april 1951 2 ppcli 
 were serving with the 27th british commonwealth brigade while it is to honour the dead of 2 ppcli that we 
 are here it seems appropriate to pay a tribute to the whole unit they the whole unit were honoured by 
 the us presidential unit citation for the gallant battle they fought in this area in april 1951 their success in 
 this battle helped prevent the enemy from continuing its advance to seoul significantly the second battalion ppcli is the only 
 canadian unit ever to have a unit citation awarded to it all members of 2 ppcli serving with the battalions 
 at the time of the kapyong battle would wear the emblem a dark blue ribbon in a gold frame on 
 both shoulders below the unit title in perpetuity all soldiers subsequently posted to the 2 ppcli would wear it while 
 they were on unit strength unfortunately the rest of the 25th candian infantry brigade group had not yet arrived in 
 korea when 2 ppcli won the award and set such a fine course for the rest of us to follow 
 they greatly enhanced the reputation of our brigade for the rest of our term here major tighe who is to 
 lay the regimental wreath was the second in command in this action following general rockingham s remarks were the last 
 post the silence of remembrance the lament and the reveille the wreath laying then took place and i together with 
 bill toews and doug preece laid the regimental wreath the wreath bearers for the ceremony were the three boys and 
 the one girl who had received the ppcli veteran student bursary which is awarded annually to a deserving student at 
 the kapyong buk middle school the blessing by the chaplains brought this impressive ceremony to an end after leaving naechon 
 we drove to kapyong to visit the kapyong commonwealth memorial australia canada new zealand and the united kingdom a similar 
 ceremony was conducted at this memorial and was followed by a picnic lunch on the memorial grounds after lunch we 
 returned to our hotel and that evening the charge d affaires for canada invited us to a reception at the 
 ambassador s residence it was a pleasant way to end what considered to be the most interesting day of our 
 visit chiefly because of the ceremony at the ppcli memorial at naechon

 24 25 1951 on saturday morning july 29th we went to the headquarters united nations command in seoul for a 
 briefing of the current military situation in korea by general kingston o the us it was most interesting and as 
 it is not possible to include everything he said in this report i think it would be reasonable to conclude 
 from his remarks that the situation existing along the demarcation line dividing north korea from south korea is extremely tense 
 and is a powder keg that could be ignited at any ime the demilitarized zone a strip 4 kilometres wide 
 and 151 miles across the korean peninsula from the han river estuary in the west to a point just below 
 the 39th parallel on the east coast has been the scene of many violations of the korean armistice agreement which 
 was signed at panmunjom on july 27th 1953 one of the most recent and most serious of the incidents took 
 place on august 18th 1976 in the joint security area at panmunjom when a group of ten united nations command 
 personnel and five korean laborers proceeded to trim a tree a routine maintenance 0:main 0:tenance task that was interfering with 
 the view from un observation posts a group of about 15 north korea peoples army kpa arrived at the scene 
 to observe what was going on shortly after their arrival an argument developed and a kpa officer sent for reinforcements 
 about 15 additional kpa soldiers arrived on he scene in a truck and almost immediately began o attack un personnel 
 with clubs crowbars and an axe killing two us army officers and injuring nine other un command personnel some seriously 
 incidents of this nature only serve to increase the tension that exists on both sides and threaten the commencement of 
 another war after general kingston s presentation we went to the un officers mess for lunch in the mess is 
 a picture of 2 ppcli s action at kapyong presented by major dick patterson following lunch we left by bus 
 for panmunjom and the joint security area in the vicinity of panmunjom and the current site of meetings of the 
 military armistice commission in the demilitarized zone we first visited the sank ak observation post canned by the rok army 
 and had a very interesting briefing by the rok lt col in command and then viewed the main features in 
 north korea on his immediate front afterwards we went to the j s a at panmunjom and entered the conference 
 room constructed astride the demarcation line here we were allowed to step into north korea without risking the creation of 
 an international incident after leaving the conference room we drove around the joint security area passing the tree which was 
 trimmed by un personnel on aug 18 1976 resulting in the brutal attack by soldiers of the kpa on un 
 personnel we then left panmunjom and returned to our hotel in seoul arriving there at about 6 00 p m 
 that evening bill boss the canadian press representative col frank kelenavic rcr and myself were invited to dinner by jo 
 kirn the interpreter for ppcli in 1951 and now a successful businessman in korea jo kirn and his wife bona 
 were most gracious hosts and gave us an excellent korean dinner m his new home located in southwest seoul overlooking 
 the han river we spent the evening reminiscing and discussmgthe remarkable progress made in korea during the past 25 years 
 even in our short visit it was evident to us all that the korean people have worked very hard to 
 achieve the present level of development jo kirn is planning to visit canada in the near future and hopes that 
 he will be able to visit many of his canadian friends before leaving korea i was able to get a 
 photograph of jo kirn his wife bona his two sons john and thadius and his daughter lucy this was our 
 last evening in korea and i was very pleased to have the good fortune of spending it in such an 
 enioyable way on sunday morning july 30th i awakened to the sound or rain on the window the first we 
 had had since leaving canada for the most part we had experienced hot and humid weather and while we were 
 in seoul we suffered a record breaking heat wave with temperatures soaring over 100 f after lunch we left for 
 the kemp airport and on arrival there we were told that our flight which originated in hong kong would be 
 two hours late due to bad weather conditions at first this did not concern us too greatly but when we 
 learned that because of our late arrival in tokyo our confirmed seats on the cp air flight from tokyo to 
 vancouver were given to other passengers we were required to remain in tokyo until tuesday evening and were all a 
 little unhappy cp air accommodated us at the imperial hotel at their expense and were most apologetic at the inconvenience

 a m the same day after a little confusion and with some difficulty i managed to get an air canada 
 flight from vancouver to ottawa via montreal and arrived home safely but a little weary looking back on the trip 
 it was really great and i am most grateful to those in the regiment who made it possible for me 
 to go and to be accompanied by two excellent representatives of the regiment warrant bill toews and warrant doug preece 
 it is impossible to name all of the delegates who were on this trip but being with them was almost 
 like being back in uniform again for a few short days and reliving for a little while those happy days 
 i spent with the regiment in particular it was a real pleasure for me to be once more with my 
 former brigade commander general rockingham throughout the whole trip he showed himself to be a real friend and a great 
 supporter of ppcli with a few minor exceptions everything went accordinng to schedule and the planning and preparatory work done 
 by the department of veterans affairs resulted in a very successful trip the minister of the department of veterans affairs 
 the honourable daniel j macdonald was an example to us all and we were all pleased to be associated with 
 him and his deputy minister mr bruce brittain the dva staff travelling with us were most cooperative and did everything 
 to ensure a happy trip for us all i am sure that all participants will agree that this is the 
 way it worked out most important of all it honoured the canadian war dead of hong kong and korea and 
 that was the purpose of the voyage september 1978 the two participating chaplains left major jim macintosh 0:macin 0:tosh who

 103 the regimental association of princess patricia s canadian light infantry by colonel w b s sutherland cd national president 
 if an association such as our own is to function well and to be capable of adapting to new situations 
 the members of it must possess a clear sense of purpose and have an unambiguous frame of reference within which 
 to operate much time has passed and a great deal has changed since the last general review of princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry association accordingly at the annual general meeting held in victoria british columbia on 2nd july 1978 
 approval was obtained to review the purposes of the association to investigate its present condition and the problems besetting branches 
 and the association generally to discover new opportunities and to decide upon a suitable programme for the future the purposes 
 and objects of the association were first enunciated by the founder and are expressed clearly in the constitution article 1 
 05 they are a to maintain the spirit of the regiment together with the comradeship and mutual regard amongst all 
 ranks formed whilst serving therein b to assist the regiment its members and ex members in all possible ways and 
 lastly c to circulate information regarding the regiment amongst members the purposes are as valid today as they have been 
 in the past what would seem to be needed therefore are ways and means of realizing them fully the purposes 
 and objects embody two central themes the first is that the ideals and ethos of the regiment should be perpetuated 
 the second is that service with the regiment should confer confraternal benefits upon all eligible persons in equal measure thus 
 it should be the purpose of the association to build and maintain a broad representative well informed highly motivated membership 
 in which all members enjoy equality of status and have an equal opportunity to plan and participate in the association 
 s affairs with the foregoing in view during the next several months working groups will be convened to undertake several 
 important tasks these are task 1 to involve the present membership in a grass roots and first principles examination of 
 the association s present condition with a view to determining appropriate ways and means of enhancing its general condition and 
 effectiveness task 2 to achieve and maintain a high level of member participation 0:partici 0:pation in policy making goal setting 
 and programme planning activities task 3 to improve communications progressively task 4 to undertake research with a view to determining 
 the number nature and location of potential new members task 5 to increase the membership level progressively by means of 
 a creating new branches if they are needed b increasing the membership lists of existing branches c involving directly members 
 at large task 6 review and revise if necessary policies programmes and practices with a view to ensuring that members 
 find membership 0:member 0:ship in the association a meaningful and satisfying experience task 7 to confirm the association s objects 
 and develop a concensus as to the best means of realizing them fully task 8 to prepare a developmental plan 
 based upon a set of approved programme objectives task 9 to develop an activity plan annually the undertaking is an 
 ambitious one and is not likely to be completed prior to the 1979 annual general meeting thus it is the 
 intention to table an interim report at the 1979 annual general meeting and a final report in 1980 one thing 
 is manifestly clear at this point in time the review cannot succeed in its overall purpose unless everyone becomes involved 
 and the work load is shared by many thus it will be necessary to delegate the tasks in whole or 
 in part to individual branches and in some cases to select committees assembled for the purpose to this end a 
 pleniary planning session was held in calgary alberta on sunday 19th november 1978 the aim to produce a plan and 
 organize the tasks was achieved the review will provide us with a valuable opportunity to strengthen the association increase its 
 effectiveness in respect of the objects it was formed to serve and build a programme within which each member may 
 find satisfaction it should prove to be a richly rewarding experience for all of those participating a complete report of 
 findings conclusions and decisions will be appearing in the next edition of the patrician november 1978
