 western canada would probably find a new literary heritage enriching our sadly limited knowledge of western fiction would be an
 impressive list of hort stories written by western canadian authors on western canadian themes such a study would be frought

 factual if an early reporter in calgary who had written the novelist like ralph connor or gilbert park book as
 juvenile fiction however when er wrote a book about the early west it was the london publishers received the manuaccepted
 as a work of fiction but what of script they were so enthusiastic about its the man whose background is
 unknown realism that they released it as adult non mr dempsey is director of history glenbow alberta institute calgary and
 editor of the alberta historical review fiction even today the book is cited as an short stories none of these
 are known to authentic source of blackfoot lore day there can be little doubt that early the most common type
 of nineteenth missionaries like john mcdougall and john century short story from western canada maclean wrote fictionalized short stories was
 written as a supposedly authentic ac for church young people s magazines rev count but treated in a fictionalized way
 the writer often took the role of an ob george mcdougall wrote two such stories little ka be o sense
 and ah nee me ke server or participant and wrote the story the son of wah bun noo sa shortly
 before as if it had actually happened for the his death in i 876 reader the problem then arises to
 determine this issue of alberta historical review whether the work is entirely factual entirely is devoted to four short stories
 which were fictional or a factual event treated in a written or published in the nineteenth fictionalized manner sometimes if
 the century they are excellent examples of event was historically significant there is tales which have a fascinating blend of
 fact ample evidence to categorize the story as and fiction each was written by an author fiction too often however
 there is not who lived in the west and who could have enough information to unreservedly classify experienced some or
 all of the adventures a tale as entirely fact or fiction he relates while all four stories probably the problem
 can be complicated if the are fiction they contain enough factual author is known to be a writer of non
 data to puzzle or entice the reader each fiction or fiction and suddenly changes is followed by an editor s
 comment which his style the rev john mcdougall is examines its historical accuracy and the known for his factual books

 from the buffalo range of the saskatchewan plains toward the rocky mountains we were going to the flathead lake during
 the day we had halted on the verge of the western wall of the great coulee that extends from milk
 river far to the north this deep troughlike depression had apparently been cut in the rocks by the strong waters
 of a mighty river long since dead the stratification of the rocks forming the walls of the canyon was horizontal
 the waters of the great river in the bygone ages incessantly nibbling the rocky walls of its bed had discovered
 the soft strata and eaten them away much faster than they had the harder strata this action of corroding waters
 had shelved the walls of the coulee into deep recesses leaving the wall of the canyon we were apparently alarmed

 far away to identify i came down loaded with wolf skins the owners had and reported to tom also that
 their anibeen wolfing all winter across the canadian mals had been driven up to their lodges border where they had
 poisoned the wolves and picketed there they were taking no they invited me to join the party which i needless
 chances with their horses he came was pleased to do a clay or two later one back in a short
 time said that he and his of tom hardwick s wagon horses went partner van were going across there miext
 badly lame the animal i was riding was morning and would i come with them i a strong red river

 to the boys i will buffalo on foot but had missed the real call you in the niormiimig sport of
 running them down on horseback soon enough i felt somneone touch miiy as buffalo were plentmtul this i could now

 his our party just thirteen in number had fingers to his lips we foumh van with tracked the marauders two
 hundred miles three horses saddled and bridled he had or so into the cypress hills where we lost everything needed
 i was told their tracks as they were heading towards we saw no signs of anyone as we rode whoop
 up it was decided to follow in the away amid were five or six miles up the same general direction
 we had no regu river before five o clock we unsaddlech at larhy appointed leader but tom hardwick a place
 where there was abundance of was generally recognized as such grass for the horses also a grove of dry at

 of sight of course and see tom wemit to work at omice with the axe if you can niake him
 out stay there until cutting down and trimming dry poplar poles you see what they do with their horses at

 pp 1 9 is we built a raft tying all the poles solidly poles however we kept it away from
 us together with pack saddle ropes when corn quite easily but when the wide spreading pleted it looked both safe
 and substantial roots were passing by some of them went i think we have earned our breakfast over the lower
 end of the raft coming van said dangerously near to upsetting it i feel that way anyway i expect the
 tom and van looked at each other then boys are having theirs by this time i re tom turned to
 me that was not a bit marked and wondering where we are comfortable he said neither van or i they
 will make a pretty good guess can swim a little bit how is it with you where we are was
 tom s rejoimider mac three long poles were placed on the raft i ani a pretty good swimmer i imagine
 to assist in keeping floating logs etc away 1 could make the bank easily if i could from us three
 roughly hewed paddles keep off that floating stuff saddles etc followed we then led the i rather thought that they
 looked at the horses into the water after a few smart green easterner with more respect afterslaps of switches they
 seemed to know which wards was wanted of them and struck straight for we had no further trouble and secured
 the opposite bank the raft where it would not be easily seen from the bend in the river where we
 we reached the bank a good bit lower than are we have fortunately struck it lucky the horses but soon
 had them saddled and said tom you can see by the floating bridled stuff in the river the current is
 towards the tom said as we rode along i have been opposite bank we pushed the raft out and thinking
 of our best mode of procedure were getting along fairly well until we not your gun not being a repeater
 mac if you iced a big floating tree coming downstream would do the cutting out van and i would which
 caused us sonic anxiety with our go fairly close with our winchesters and be when we got opposite their camp
 we lay down behind some brush where we could see everything which might be going on 19 prepared to turn
 loose on them if you are it will ease your conscience we will call it discovered you know a couple
 of win that chesters fired at top speed would make them the canip was practically empty all of think that
 a whole troop of us were there the indians were down at the river side however if you would rather
 not one of some of their friends across the river were us will go amid you stay behind with a
 win calling to them but on account of the noise chester miiade by the rushing water they could not oh
 i said i will undertake the cutting make out what was saich being away from out if it is needed
 i understand my owmi the river we could actually hear better gun best i then told them that when i
 than they could was up the hill watching with the field cami you make out what they are sayimig glasses
 i noticed a deep gulch running up tom from the river and that it was within a few yes i
 can ‘ white men over there look hundred yards of the indians camp o mt when within a mile or
 so of the gulch not very emicouraging is it but we we tied our horses up and proceeded on niay
 get a chance yet foot van went to the top of the gulch once van said there was an old
 dug out or twice in case there might be lurking canoe over there top heavy and miot too indians who
 might discover us when we safe at any time perhaps they may try that got opposite their camp we lay
 down be the words were not much more than hind some brush where we could see every said when we
 saw them launching the canthing which might be going on the horses oe two indians got into it and began
 to were grazing within two hundred yards of paddle across in midstream it upset we us the instant i looked
 at the blue roan could not make out the cause neither could i knew it was not the horse i
 had traded we see any sign of the occupants but the with tom mournful screaming of the women as they
 our trip is all for nothing tom that hurried downstream after the upset canoe is not your horse was quite
 suficient to let us know what was at niy remark they both turned in the happening most surprised manmier why
 you darned poor souls i said they will have to greenhorn do you suppose we are going he strong swimmers
 if they get out of that to leave that bunc h of horses here after all van turned to me
 quite angry like poor our trouble not if we have a ghost of a souls nothimig murdering devils is what
 they chance that bunch would run off our are the only good indians are dead indihorses and we are going
 to treat them iii ans quite a comiimon expression in the exactly the sanie way west which one hundred years
 of brutal i coimld see at omice by the way they warfare between the two races will easily spoke that
 it niight not be quite safe for account for i had that peculiar sensation imi me to oppose them there
 was nothing i niy scalp which i suppose is called hair could do i could not cross the river alone
 standing on end shades of rob roy i thought is this two men dead solely on account of our going
 to be a reversion to type well my visit i did not like it a little bit the imidiamis own
 thieving ancestors would say that it finally umiderstood what was being called was the right and proper thing to do
 when to themn and hurried back to camp two or that fanious british regimemit the black three went out at
 once and drove the horses watch were first enrolled it was chiefly to up where they were picketed a dozen
 or so act as police in order to curb the thieving were walking about the camp guns in hand propensities
 of the gentry both highland we watched them for an hour or more and lowland the name would indicate amid
 then went back to our horses after how popular it was supper and nearly dark we wemit back to oh
 well i remarked suppose we call our former position everything seemed this a horse trading expedition instead of quiet in
 the camp sometime before midhorse thieving one night toni went to scout around and see they both laughed all right
 mac if what he could find out he left his win 20 the indians were evidently all alarmed and had
 got a ‘ big scare at the notion of the whites being on the warpath chester behind hut had his
 revolver in his at once torn and van began with their belt he was back in about an hour he
 had winchesters an d they certainly did make crept up behind one of the lodges where some noise the shooting
 became general he could hear two or three talking about hut now they were shooting at the flashes what had
 been called to them hut they did i began to move towards toni and van not seem to be at
 all alarmed most likely cautiously of course then to mny alarm the white men had crossed on business of the
 shooting stopped suddenly something their own and were miles away by that tinie gone wrong i thought and began to
 run to by the way they talked and acted they them whemi i got near tomn whispered is will be
 sound asleep in a short time yotm that you mac are still game to do the cutting out yes i
 answered yes i said my god van has been hit and 1 am if you are successful keep the horses
 afraid it is bad there and strike a miiatch behind one we will watch out for it and be with
 you iii van was lying dowmi we took an arm no time each amid began moving towards the gulch van
 was comiscious because lie was taking i was getting along fimme with my part of slow shuffling steps we were
 niaking slow the business until i got hold of the rope of progress because we were actually more a nervous
 half broken animal perhaps the than half carrying him meanwhile there scent was differemit it began pulling back was quite
 an uproar iii the indians camp the harder 1 tried to get up to it it backed i looked back
 from the top of the gulch and faster and faster until it caine right up it seemed to me that
 the lodges were all against another horse instantly with a vici down so they must be leaving we carried ous
 squeal it lashed out with both himid van to the bottom of the gulch and laid feet the crash against
 the other animal s him down side could be heard a quarter of a mile away the indians were out
 in an instant tom said we must have a light to see and two or three fired their guns into
 the the wound and attend to it air i suppose i will go up and see whiat they are do
 21 ing if they are moving away we can start he was gone a fire at once tom was miiore
 affected than i thought whemi i got to the top daylight was corn was possible we covered the body with
 ing and i saw that some of them were ab some brush and hastened down to our ready gone the
 balance were working fast horses then we rode up to the raft in a they are clearing out you can
 safely mad gallop start a fire just turn them loose toni said we he struck a match and touched it
 off must hurry it would he awful if a coyote van s wound was through the chest there were to
 find him whilst we were gone was very little blood outside so it must be it was a very sad
 party that crossed the inside he was bleeding i was kneeling by river some time later to where van lay
 his side i laid my hand on him he covered when all was ready toni turned to hank it with
 his own and whispered very low and your people were church goers can you weak like i am done for
 but it does not think of what should be said hank lookmatter it had to come sometime he was ed
 helplessly at us then he bent down took famlmng fast up a handful of sand removing his hat at can
 t you say a prayer mac lie the same time whispered very low oh lord we were horn to sin
 but van i had said the lord s prayer many times was a very decent chap who never deserted but
 never with half the earnestness which a friend in times of need be kind to him i did then the
 request moved me beyond lord and forgive him ashes to ashes and belief towards the end his hand slipped dust
 to dust the handful of sand was off mine and i heard a gentle sigh i knew thrown onto the
 ground amen editor s comments this is a fascinating piece of fiction were decidedly hostile so the mcmi finally which
 donald graham has woven into a decided to return to fort benton emptytrue adventure which he experienced in handed 1

 of calgary and joined a party going mio trace of oimr stock the indians were south via fort whoop up
 to montana evidently all alarmed and had got a ‘ big shortly before they reachech fort benton scare at the
 notion of the whites being on their horses were stolen the men including the warpath we saw it was impossible
 to ton i hardwick and trevanian hale the find out what band had taken our horses van mentioned in his
 story followed so turned our faces bentommwards again not the raiders to a fort in the cypress hills wishimig to
 harmim any indians but the right there they lost the trail but became involved party although we had plenty chances
 to in a fight with a party of assiniboines this do so had we so desired bozeinan avant imicident becanie
 famous as the cypress courier july 4 1873 hills massacre in later years graliani made two at after it was
 over the party went to fort tempts to write short fictionalized stories whoop up and it was there that graham
 based on his experiences but neither was tells the fictionalized version which we have published the other dealt with a
 prem noniprinted here graham also left an accurate tiomi that he would kill two deer when huntaccount which was published
 by the ed ing in montana monton journal on feb 9 and march 29 the most obvious evidence that graham
 s 1924 there he told how the party found adventure story is fiction is that it is at a large
 bhackfoot camp near whoop up variance with his factual account the other and searched it without success the indians and
 even more conclusive evidence is the fact that van hale was not killed during the indian camps his other detaibs
 are reathe expedition he was one of the men hater sonably accurate charged by the canadian government for grahamii s
 story is an intriguing one parhims part mn the mnassacre but never stood ticuharly as it is coupled with his
 true cxtrial he died near harlowton montana periences in the cypress hills mnassacre in about 1907 that he should have
 taken a part of this there also are a couple of historical iii dramatic event and used two of its
 prominaccuracies in grahani s story first he tells ent characters in his story makes this acof the indians inability to
 shout across the count a unique examp le of early western flood swollen river to warn their friends canadian fiction
 the fact that he had the about the horse raiders in this he forgets reputation of being a scrupulously honest
 about the remarkable ability of the indians person people used to say he was too to comniunicate by sign language
 also he honest for his own good said his tells of the blackfoot trying to cross the daughter iiiakes it
 highly unlikely that river in a dug out canoe ignoring the fact graham was trying to spin a tall tale
 and that such craft were unknown to that tribe pass it off as the truth rather this story however having
 been through the area was apparently written to entertain but during the tinie described and having visited had never been
 published trouble at walters ferry a barge tree caught on the ferry cable on wednesday and gave it a hard
 racket the cable was lowered to let the tree pas s and the current was so heavy owing to the
 high water that it could not he raised again while it was lying in the water so much driftwood caught
 on it that the stake to which it was fastened on the north side was pulled out and floated down
 the river as far as the cable would reach forming a kind of buoy which caught and held a great
 deal of driftwood causing a heavy strain on the cable the ferryman worked hard the greater part of thursday to
 get it clear but without avail lii the evening about a dozen men went over from the fort and succeeded
 in getting the cable clear of the water without damage and coiling it up on the south bank of the
 river where it will have to remain for a good while unless the steamer will assist in stretching it when
 she comes up again the scow is being rigged with oars in the old fashioned way but she is so
 large and the river so high and swift that crossing is very difficult job and seems harder miow after the
