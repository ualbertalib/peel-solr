 regimental commander th is year 1954 marks the fortieth anniversary of princess patricia s canadian light infantry during the forty 
 years of its life battalions of the regiment have fought with great distinction in both world wars i and ii 
 and in korea in all nearly nine years have been spent in combat with the enemy on foreign battlefields thousands 
 upon thousands of canadians have served in the regiment anywhere you go in canada 0:can 0:ada you will find men 
 in all walks of life who are honoured to claim ppcli as their regiment today the regiment consists of the 
 regimental depot and the first battalion stationed at currie barracks in calgary the second battalion serving in germany and a 
 militia battalion the loyal edmonton regiment 3rd bn ppcli located at edmonton alberta this latter unit has only recently become 
 affiliated with ppcli and it is a welcome addition of which the regiment can be proud the regimental depot is 
 the heart of the regiment here recruits receive their initial introduction to and training in the regiment it is the 
 repository of regimental treasures many of which are held in the regimental museum i might say in passing that this 
 museum is one of the finest of its kind in the canadian army on 1 october 1954 i had the 
 honour to be the reviewing officer at the trooping of its regimental colour by the first battalion at currie barracks 
 i can say without fear of contradiction that the standard of drill and the bearing and discipline of all ranks 
 who participated in this ceremonial were of the highest order and in the best traditions of the regiment on 9 
 october 1954 the second battalion in germany trooped its regimental colour from all accounts the quality of their drill bearing 
 and discipline were equally superb i am confident from what i have seen of its presently serving members that the 
 honours and traditions of princess patricia s canadian light infantry are in safe hands

 the patrician 3 the writer recalls the commanding officer s room at the headquarters of the regiment in winnipeg where 
 more than twenty years ago the recruit 0:re 0:cruit was shown the original colour jim christie s sniper rifle and 
 other treasures in april 1950 the regimental intelligence 0:in 0:telligence officer lt d r brochu now captain was the author 
 of operation old clippings the object of this exercise was to put the regimental museum in a state of readiness 
 during the korean campaign the regimental museum was relegated to a basement storage room however it is due to the 
 interest and work of the regimental officers and men who have had a hand in this project through the years 
 that so much of value remains today on formation of the regimental depot 1 june 1953 plans were immediately made 
 to establish the museum on a firm and permanent basis under the curatorship of the commanding officer suitable accommodation 0:ac 
 0:commodation was the initial requirement 0:require 0:ment in february 1954 with the cooperation 0:co 0:operation of the commanding officer 1

 the patrician 7 in memoriam late regimental sergeant major t j turnbull it is with deepest sorrow that the regiment 
 records the death on 4 november 1954 in winnipeg of rsm t j turnbull loved and respected by all he 
 will never be forgotten in the regiment 
 the patrician 8 regimental sergeant major t j turnbull rsm turnbull was born in 1871 and enlisted in the argyle 
 and sutherland highlanders as a boy in 1886 he served as both piper and bandsman 0:bands 0:man with the 93rd 
 and after a tour of duty in india was selected to attend the course for bandmasters at famed kneller hall 
 whilst he was en route to the hall the south african war broke out and rather than remain there for 
 the three year course he elected to return to his regiment and proceeded with it to south africa as a 
 duty nco seriously wounded at the battle of the modder river he was posted to the home establishment and transferred 
 0:transfer 0:red to the band of the scots guards in 1902 he qualified as a drum major and was appointed 
 as such to the royal inniski i ling fusiliers his service with this famous regiment included 0:in 0:cluded a tour 
 in egypt and the period of hostilities 1914 1918 rsm turnbull was promoted to the rank of wol in 1914 
 he retired to pension in 1920 having completed 34 years of service in the imperial army early in 1921 he 
 came to canada in connection with the post war organization 0:organi 0:zation of the permanent force and in the same 
 year was appointed as rsm ppcli his career in the canadian army is a matter of legend much of the 
 fine reputation established by the regiment 0:regi 0:ment during the years between the wars was attributable to t j his 
 vast knowledge of procedures and customs of the service his bearing and awe inspiring figure were unparalleled in the west 
 strict to the last degree there never was a rsm more fatherly to recruits or more helpful to young ncos 
 he retired to pension in august 1934 after a period totalling 47 continuous 0:con 0:tinuous years in uniform great soldier 
 and perfect gentleman the mark he left in the regiment is indelible rsm turnbull died on 4 november 1954 and 
 was buried with full military 0:mili 0:tary honours in the field of honour brookside cemetery winnipeg the regiment was represented 
 at his funeral by major h g munro and rsm o gardner both of whom had served under him a 
 tribute to a fine soldier the late major general r f l keller cbe dear major munro very many thanks 
 for your letter of 1 bth october and your perseverance to carry out mrs r f l keller s wish 
 to acknowledge a small tribute from the ex officers of 3 canadian infantry division and 2 canadian armoured brigade residing 
 in this part of ontario 0:on 0:tario as members of a unified force created and led into battle by a 
 rugged g o c and former commanding officer 0:of 0:ficer of your gallant regiment we find that the war and 
 the subsequent passage 0:pas 0:sage of time has little effect on the common bond that was created and now holds 
 us together simultaneously each year on june 6th we meet in toronto montreal in the maritimes and elsewhere in canada 
 as ex members 0:ex 0:mem 0:bers of this unified force something quite unique in the canadian army this bond and 
 experience is a tribute to the character and leadership of a former commanding officer of yours and a magnificent g 
 o c to us we are grateful to you for your letter informing us of the last parade of our 
 g o c yours very sincerely john a d craig lt col retired daqmg and t aa qmg 3 cdn

 the patrician 9 first battalion report it has been an eventful and at times hectic half year since the last 
 issue of the patrician was put to bed much has happened which is memorable and deserves recounting within these pages 
 much else of importance has passed from memory or because of space limitations cannot be recorded here only the highlights 
 are described 0:de 0:scribed in other than cursory fashion no mention can be made of certain 0:cer 0:tain of our 
 activities in the interests of national security we hope therefore that our readers will bear with us if no mention 
 is made of our airborne activities random thoughts august 1954 marked the 40th anniversary of princess patricia s canadian light 
 infantry and regrettably 0:re 0:grettably this important anniversary seems to have gone unnoticed it seems strange indeed that such an 
 occasion 0:oc 0:casion should be permitted to slip away unmarked by ceremony or celebration 0:cele 0:bration in her four decades 
 the proud regiment 0:regi 0:ment in which we serve has compiled an auspicious record of which it can truly be 
 said that it is second to none pause for a moment and regard these few jewels plucked at random from 
 the regimental diadem first canadian regiment into action world war i the canadian regiment longest in action in world war 
 i selected from among a host of distinguished 0:dis 0:tinguished regiments to form part of canada s permanent force after 
 world war i with canada s vanguard in 1939 into sicily as a unit of the assault element of 1 
 canadian division and thereafter continuously engaged in italy and north west europe until ye day selected for service in the 
 pacific as a unit of canada s pacific force first of canada s peace time airborne regiments 0:regi 0:ments first 
 canadian regiment to serve in the far east during the korean incident the regiment longest in action in korea first 
 canadian regiment to be awarded the united states of america presidential citation the canadian regiment which has served longest in 
 action against canada s enemies since 1914 the foregoing are only a few of the salient historical facts to which 
 we can point with pride there are more subtle and intangible indications of excellence which cannot be enumerated 0:enumer 0:ated 
 here it is axiomatic that individuals 0:individu 0:als who are honoured to serve the queen under our colour lead in 
 matters 0:mat 0:ters of professional competence patricia s invariably come first our sub units prove better when pitted against the 
 equivalents of our sister regiments i e note the results of ex trial reported in our wainwright account ours is 
 a proud heritage let us not soon forget it trivia the battalion has acquired a mascot appropriately it is a 
 dog his name is mike mike is a large dog his lineage is obscure but it is apparent that a 
 majority of his ancestors must have been old english sheepdogs perhaps 0:per 0:haps my remarks or aspersions as you will 
 are not fair to mike who is not sufficiently intelligent to write a rebuttal 0:re 0:buttal or could it be 
 that he is too intelligent in any event mike is a kindly soul his eyes when apparent are clear and 
 intelligent or so the rsm assures me he is now attending a canine kindergarten 0:kinder 0:garten which the rsm says 
 will give him some culture the instructor might even cultivate in him a love of music 
 the patrician 10 in which case mike can take his rightful 0:right 0:ful place with the drums there is absolutely 
 no foundation to the rumour which has it that mike will attend a parachutist course the io assures me that 
 the rumour originated in the sergeants mess and that although 0:al 0:though most rumours which originate there have some basis 
 in fact this one has none he has also assured me that rumours are bad generally mike has no comment 
 he is a complacent dog summer concentration 1954 by lt w l watt on 14 jun 54 1 bn ppcli 
 arrived in wainwright 0:wain 0:wright where the battalion area was selected in the vicinity of border lake on arrival the 
 troops contrived to make themselves comfortable in an ingenious invention known as a shelter half after a day of settling 
 in training began in earnest on a sub unit level all phases of war were exercised until 30 june when 
 amidst a cloud of wainwright s well known fly population 0:popula 0:tion the first phase was concluded presumably it was 
 a success following the brigade skill at arms day the moved to the betty lake area for the commencement 0:com 
 0:mencement of phase 2 this period consisted of a series of battalion exercises a variety of interesting operations were performed 
 among the green rolling hills of the western paradise such things as swimming in the battle river under the guise 
 of a planned river crossing and attempting 0:at 0:tempting to follow centurion tanks cross country 0:cross 0:coun 0:try proved very 
 popular these mysterious goings on lasted until a sunny 12 july presumably 0:pre 0:sumably this phase was also a success 
 the final phase of the concentration began on the south side of the battle river on the crossing 0:cross 0:ing 
 the patricias hit their full stride and even the control staff was unable to maintain the pace the result was 
 that the unit had taken their objectives before the objectives existed this caused a great deal of concern to the 
 higher echelons but the general opinion was that we are here so what are you going to do about it 
 needless to say many friendships with the control 0:con 0:trol staff were destroyed eventually phase 3 came to a shuddering 
 halt as the enemy was completely overwhelmed preparations began for leaving this summer resort 0:re 0:sort and returning to the 
 trials and tribulations of civilized life in calgary on 26 july 1 battalion 0:bat 0:talion again marched through the gates 
 of currie barracks to commence the business of garrison life once more o for many the highlight of the summer 
 concentration 0:con 0:centration was the battalion s superb showing on exercise trail trail was designed as a test for sub 
 units of company strength it consisted of a series of tactical situations which required of the company being tested that 
 it deploy and commit 0:com 0:mit first a section to deal with a snipers nest then a platoon to take 
 out a section position and lastly a full company attack with supporting arms to deal with a platoon locality the 
 trial was staged over typical terrain and envisaged an advance by the company being exercised all rifle companies participating in 
 the brigade concentration were exercised units represented were 1 rcr 1 ppcli and i qor of c final ranking of 
 the participants in order of merit revealed that of the 12 ranked 1 ppcli had copped the first 3 positions

 a miniature diamond the dimensions of which are appropriate to the physical capabilities of the players 0:play 0:ers the equipment 
 used is standard equipment in miniature plus a specially designed skull protector which all batters 0:bat 0:ters are required to 
 wear when at the 
 the patrician 12 plate the rules are the same but certain 0:cer 0:tain restrictions have been written into the league 
 constitution to protect the players against physical exploitation and to provide boys of different age groups between 9 and 12 
 with an equal opportunity to play little league baseball is new to calgary 0:cal 0:gary though well known elsewhere on 
 the continent when it was first learned at the battalion that it was planned to organize a local league the 
 regiment requested permission to be represented at the organizational meeting when satisfied that the patricias could be of service to 
 the youth of calgary the commanding officer 0:of 0:ficer undertook to sponsor a team thus the patricia giants came into 
 being the giants played in the national league division of the calgary organization 0:organi 0:zation and while not winning the 
 league championship had a splendid year it is the local consensus that they shall prove of championship calibre next year 
 although the unit sponsored team did not enter the city finals the regiment 0:regi 0:ment was much in evidence when 
 a champion was declared and feted a permanent trophy for annual award to the winning team was presented to the 
 league by the battalion the initial presentation was made to the champion dodgers by major a v robbins acting on 
 behalf of the commanding 0:com 0:manding officer a large crowd was on hand to witness the presentation musketry by wo2 
 roberts e o shades of the 19305 rifle shooting appears 0:ap 0:pears to be coming back into its own due 
 to such exigencies of the service as world war 11 korea para training mobile striking force commitments and all the 
 multiudinous activities of a modern infantry soldier there just didn t seem time for organized competitive 0:competi 0:tive rifle shooting 
 in fact the term annual classification was rapidly becoming obsolescent 0:obsoles 0:cent the pendulum is swinging back however and this 
 year has shown some satisfying results 0:re 0:sults particularly in straight service shooting annual classification is back to stay and 
 while the percentage of marksmen in the regiment 0:regi 0:ment may not be as high as in pre war days 
 it should be pointed out at this time that the standard for marksman has been set high deliberately in order 
 to mark with distinction those acquiring marksman status the prewas 0:pre 0:was standard for marksman you may remember 0:remem 0:ber 
 was an average of inners and entitled the soldier to wear crossed rifles crossed rifles now denote first class shot 
 and pukka marksmen wear crossed rifles and crown firstly let us look at this year s annual classification no longer 
 is it possible 0:possi 0:ble as in pre war days to parade the unit as strong as possible on a 
 given day after an intensive period of musketry training where everyone would compete on reasonably equal terms i e same 
 weather conditions sub units are now allotted a period in which to classify and dependent on individuals availability returning 0:re 
 0:turning from courses etc classify when the opportunity presents itself thus some individuals classify on a warm spring day others 
 may fire at zero temperatures 0:tempera 0:tures this factor alone precludes an accurate selection of company or regimental shot nevertheless 
 there were some thirty marksmen and over one hundred first class shots secondly at the wainwright summer concentration 0:con 0:centration 
 this summer the regiment placed second in the skill at arms competition for 2 canadian infantry brigade and placed l 
 first in the rifle competition and first in the bren competition this competition embraced small arms grenades judging distance etc 
 thirdly at the alberta provincial rifle meet held at camp sarcee 3 8 july 54 the unit for the first 
 time in several yea rs was able to field a strong rifle team 16 members complete with parker hale sights 
 telescopes bullseye juice etc at this meet again our best showing was in straight service shooting notably armstrong plate team

 maintained trooping the colour the trooping staged at currie barracks 0:bar 0:racks on 1 october 1954 was the equal of 
 any previous trooping performed 0:per 0:formed by the regiment all ranks rose magnificently to the occasion to ensure its success 
 at the outset preparations were beset 0:be 0:set by adversity it was not possible to allocate personnel to guards nor 
 to commence individual training until 10 september since until that date an insufficient 0:in 0:sufficient number of persons had returned 
 0:re 0:turned to duty then it was discovered that well over half of the men on parade had never before 
 participated in a trooping this astonishing state of affairs imposed upon the rsm warrant 0:war 0:rant officers and ncos an 
 additional burden and required that a greater emphasis be placed upon individual refresher training then the weather turned incredibly foul 
 temperatures dropped from the balmy 70 s to frigid 30 s and remained at these sub arctic levels for well 
 over a fortnight rehearsals were performed 0:perform 0:ed in rain sleet and snow two of the final three rehearsals had 
 to be postponed because of snow and ice conditions on the parade square rehearsals staged under such conditions 0:con 0:ditions 
 were especially hard upon the 
 the patrician 14 band who complained of swollen lips numb fingers cracked clarinet barrels and ruined reeds almost miraculously on 
 trooping day the weather moderated and the benevolent sun saw fit to smile the brightening of the weather picture was 
 accepted as an omen of celestial intervention 0:inter 0:vention and inspired all to give of their best the public and 
 friends of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment blessed with strong faith that all would be well turned out in great numbers 
 it is estimated that 4000 were in attendance the ceremony was preceded by a band concert arranged and conducted by 
 captain ray mcleod and by an introductory address delivered by major h g munro markers were sounded at 1430 hrs 
 and at 1440 hrs the escort and guards marched onto the square preceded 0:pre 0:ceded by the drums the parade 
 was formed halted and dressed by the rsm who then handed over to the adjutant the adjutant played his role 
 and in turn handed over to the commanding 0:com 0:manding officer the co then ordered the officers and warrant officers 
 to their allotted posts the latter movement 0:move 0:ment done to the traditional strains of land of hope and glory 
 upon the arrival of major general c yokes cb cbe dso cd general officer commanding western command 0:com 0:mand who 
 had kindly consented to review the battalion on this occasion the commanding officer ordered a general salute and reported the 
 parade ready to troop then began the historic ceremony the band and drums led by d m e o rohac 
 marched from right to left in quick time and from left to right in slow time the drummers call was 
 sounded and major e r sharpe commanding the escort changed places with lt r s peacock subaltern of the escort 
 the escort moved out to receive the colour to the strains of british grenadiers the colour was received by rsm 
 j g austin mc cd and entrusted to lt c b snider mc after a general salute the colour was 
 trooped through the ranks for many men on parade it was their first view of the colour at close hand 
 there followed the march past in slow and quick time and finally the advance in review order climaxed by a 
 general salute the trooping and attendant movements 0:move 0:ments was complete and lt col j r cameron obe requested of 
 the reviewing 0:re 0:viewing officer that he say a few words to the troops general yokes obliged by commending all 
 ranks on the manner in which they had conducted 0:con 0:ducted themselves and performed the historic ceremony the address over 
 the battalion formed three ranks dressed and marched off immediately after the parade a reception 0:re 0:ception for the public 
 was held on the polo field it was well attended and proved to be an unexpected success 0:suc 0:cess much 
 credit is due the ladies auxiliary who undertook to assist at serving and performed this difficult task with great skill 
 during the evening the officers held the annual trooping ball and the men their annual trooping dance the men s 
 dance was held in harvey hall at 2100 hrs and was restricted to men and their ladies stags were discouraged 
 0:dis 0:couraged from attending and were offered solace in the form of a stag night at the wet canteen from 
 all accounts the latter was a great success the dance was a quiet affair but much enjoyed by all who 
 attended a good orchestra was engaged and provided 0:pro 0:vided excellent dancing music general and mrs yokes together with lt 
 col and mrs cameron visited the dance shortly after 2100 hrs several 0:sev 0:eral regimental officers accompanied by their ladies 
 were in attedance during 0:dur 0:ing the early stages of the evenng

 boxing the first post war boxing tournament 0:tourna 0:ment was held at currie barracks on wednesday november 3rd 1954 the 
 tournament was staged as a preliminary 0:pre 0:liminary to the western command boxing tournament to be held at currie 0:cur 
 0:rie barracks from the 10th to 19th of november in all eight action packed bouts were staged with battalion novice 
 champions being declared in lightweight 0:light 0:weight welterweight middleweight light heavyweight and heavyweight classes open champions were decided 0:de 0:cided 
 on both lightweight and middleweight 0:middle 0:weight divisions in the remaining weight classifications championships were not contested it was a 
 stirring spectacle to see the whole of the battalion on hand to support the fighters and a most appropriate 0:ap 
 0:propriate acknowledgment of the fine qualitities of sportsmanship courage 0:cour 0:age and skill which all witnessed the lead off bout 
 set the pace with two of the most energetic novice lightweights 0:light 0:weights competing for the dubious honour of engaging 
 in yet another bout on the same program to declare

 the patrician 18 a novice lightweight champion pte c carson of support company who weighed in at 134 lbs proved 
 to be the winner on a close split verdict over pte b c winters of b company carson less skilled 
 than his opponent set the early pace and was a veritable whirling dervish he threw punches from every conceivable angle 
 occasionally 0:oc 0:casionally scoring with a solid smash and by his energy and zeal managing to offset his opponent s 
 superior punching 0:punch 0:ing power winters recovered in the second round and began to score solidly by the third round 
 carson was bleeding profusely from the nose and presented an incredibly bloody sight however he refused to let up for 
 a minute and in spite of being in trouble in the final round lasted to the bell to win the 
 verdict the second bout was a welterweight match pitting sgt d d mitchell sniper sgt against pte w m lemieux 
 of hq company mitchell at 146 lbs outweighed 0:out 0:weighed his opponent by some 18 lbs and made good use 
 of the weight advantage he showed superiority in every phase of the fight to win easily the middleweight elimination proved 
 to be one of the most interesting 0:interest 0:ing bouts of the match it brought together 0:to 0:gether two b 
 company battlers sgt g s debney at 158 lbs and pte r l g sponchia at 149 lbs proved to 
 be remarkably 0:re 0:markably well matched debney was the harder puncher and appeared to be in superb physical condition his 
 punches were straight and true and particularly telling at close range sponchia gave an excellent account of himself and in 
 the latter stages was giving as good as he got he proved to be particularly dangerous when hurt and captured 
 the sympathies of of the crowd with his plucky display debney deserved full credit for the victory the light heavyweight 
 battle produced 0:pro 0:duced the only technical knock out of the program pte e p handspiker of hq coy won 
 over pte r f leforte of c coy when lt w h jans stopped the bout late in the third 
 round leforte refused to go down despite a terrific pounding to the head previous to the third round he had 
 scored as often as his opponent but the margin of difference 0:dif 0:ference was in the power of the blows 
 delivered by handspiker leforte gained much praise despite his defeat the heavyweight division was entirely 0:en 0:tirely a d company 
 affair with pte h griesbach at 185 lbs meeting pte s schiweck at 175 lbs it was immediately 0:im 0:mediately 
 apparent that the heavier boxer had the advantage of style and power over his spirited opponent who forced the pace 
 at the outset the two scrappers traded punches at lightweight 0:light 0:weight pace and had the crowd on the edge 
 of their seats schiweck took a considerable pounding but in spite of it swarmed after his cool headed opponent twice 
 the referee examined schiweck to determine whether the fight should be allowed to continue and on both occasions permitted it 
 to resume griesbach won easily but it was generally conceded that his opponent 0:op 0:ponent had proved to be the 
 most courageous fighter of the afternoon the final novice bout brought together 0:to 0:gether pte carson winner of the first 
 bout and pte parisian of hq coy parisian weighed in one pound heavier than carson who in spite of the 
 previous 0:previ 0:ous punishment inflicted on him by winters looked fresh the fight was almost a repetition of the first 
 bout with carson getting the referee s nod after the three judges had arrived at a draw verdict carson was 
 a popular 0:popu 0:lar winner the two open class eliminations were excellent displays of boxing skill in the first pte 
 l lavallee a well conditioned 136 lbs professional from hq coy proved too good for pte g mills of b 
 coy former golden glove boxer and southern alberta lightweight 0:light 0:weight champion lavallee was much the better boxer and won 
 easily his ring craftsmanship was excellent and adjudged by many to be the best display 0:dis 0:play of the afternoon 
 
 the patrician 19 in the middleweight open sgt g s schamehorn and pte d cameron both of b coy met 
 for the crown schamehorn 0:schame 0:horn a popular professional fighter of wide experience won going away his powerful punching on 
 the inside overcame the longer reach of his opponent 0:op 0:ponent and earned him a well deserved 0:de 0:served victory 
 cameron a well built fighter of above average ability made it an interesting scrap before running out of steam in 
 the sth and final round at the conclusion of the tournament 0:tourna 0:ment prizes were presented to the winners by

 lt j d campbell extracts from the first issue were published for the regimental record 0:re 0:cord in the march 
 issue of the journal the paper has been named vox pat and extracts 0:ex 0:tracts from the march and july 
 issues are published here for the regimental records message from the commanding officer i think it is fitting in this 
 our fourth issue of the vox pat to comment briefly on our accomplishments in germany to date and also to 
 forecast some of our activities in the near future some eight months ago we arrived at fort macleod then unnamed 
 with a strength of just 500 all ranks today our strength is well over 1000 all ranks our training has 
 run from operational readiness drills in the schwerte area to putlos in february 54 then to soltau 0:sol 0:tau for 
 one month then a return engagement in putlos the last two weeks in june through this schedule we have had 
 the support company 0:com 0:pany platoon competitions and rifle firing by companies at sennelager in addition we have conducted one 
 junior nco course and four recruits courses the fourth one still underway all this has meant a heavy training load 
 on the unit but let us examine the result we are now fully established and trained fit for war and 
 that is and always will be the aim where do we go from here our next intensive 0:in 0:tensive training 
 period will be the brigade concentration at sennelagar from 15 to 29 august shortly afterwards we will engage in the 
 corps manoeuvres battle royal from 15 to 23 sep in these exercises we will be part of a belgium corps 
 soon we will start a hard schedule of ceremonial drill training to prepare 0:pre 0:pare for the trooping the colour 
 ceremony on 9 oct 54 this memorable day will bring us nearly full circle on our training cycle the 1954 
 1955 winter program will stress individual 0:individ 0:ual and specialist training to improve our standards and fit us for any 
 tasks that may lie ahead i am well satisfied with our progress and performance to date we are members of 
 the finest infantry battalion in europe let us maintain that modest standard 
 the patrician 20 fort macleod fort macleod was established in 1874 by the north west mounted police who marched 0:march 
 0:ed into the west that year its first site was an island in the old man s river some 100 
 miles south of the present city of calgary the fort became the headquarters of the force in 1876 in 1883 
 the post having become untenable owing to a change in the course of the river a new fort was established 
 two and a half miles west where it gave an impetus to the growth of the nearby village of macleod 
 0:mac 0:leod fort macleod was one of the chief bases from which the mounted police carried on their work of 
 enforcing the law and advancing 0:ad 0:vancing civilization in the canadian west it was finally abandoned as a police post

 be grateful if you will extend my congratulations to the editor the editorial staff the contributors and all others who 
 have participated in this very worth while project the contents of this issue reveal a very active and aggressive battalion

 now through the medium of the newsletter it becomes possible for members of the unit to record for posterity the 
 events from the horse s mouth as it were for info all subscribers respectfully submitted a l hill lieut kapyong 
 by l cpl davy this is a simple story written in plain words devoid of all heroics usually associated with 
 such articles this also is the reason for any member of the battalion to put a little extra swagger in 
 their walk because the first and only battalion of the canadian army to have won the distinguished unit citation granted 
 by the president of the united states of america is the 2nd battalion princess patricia s 0:pa 0:tricia 0:s canadian 
 light infantry there will be no mention of names connected with deeds of gallantry by individuals firstly because to name 
 a few is to leave countless unrecognized 0:unrecogniz 0:ed secondly no man can keep track of five or six hundred 
 others and lastly because 0:be 0:cause this deals with a unit which is every man in a battalion since i 
 have to start somewhere we will first give an explanation of the group the battalion belonged to it was the 
 27th british 0:bri 0:tish commonwealth brigade composed of the argyle and sutherland highlanders the middlesex 0:mid 0:dlesex regiment the 3rd 
 royal australian regiment the 2 bn princess patricia s canadi 
 the patrician 21 an light infantry the 16th new zealand field regiment as supporting artillery aided by an american 4 
 2 mortar company and company a of the 72nd heavy tank battalion with in addition the 60th indian field ambulance 
 for about a month we had been advancing up and over rugged icy hills against scattered 0:scatter 0:ed resistance and 
 at last stopped on positions known as the fish line after holding these positions for a few days our battalion 
 was relieved by a battalion of the 6th rok republic 0:re 0:public of korea division and we headed back for 
 what we thought would be a good long rest in the kapyong brigade rest area for a couple of days 
 everything was as planned and hoped for getting cleaned up seeing a show or two mysteriously appearing in one of 
 the british company lines every time they had a brew of tea or any other kind of brew and generally 
 relaxing on the morning of 23 april 1951 visions of a long rest started to diminish rapidly as obvious preparations 
 for a move were started 0:start 0:ed each man s equipment was checked to see that he had enough ammunition 
 and grenades 0:gren 0:ades and the other bare essentials an infantry soldier requires the communist forces had launched a very 
 strong attack 6th rok division 0:divis 0:ion had become split up and were losing their positions rapidly at 1900 hours 
 we embussed on trucks and started to move north the roads and junctions 0:junc 0:tions were jammed with retreating south 
 korean 0:kor 0:ean soldiers on foot every imaginable type of vehicle was loaded with troops and equipment 0:equip 0:ment at 
 2000 hours we debussed and climbed 0:climb 0:ed to the positions to be occupied that night by 0100 hours 24 
 april 1951 we were dug in and put on a fifty percent stand to one man in every slit trench 
 on guard meanwhile the australians to our right front were attacked by heavy forces while they were moving into their 
 positions and during the night had quite a few killed and wounded 0:wound 0:ed at the same time the argyles 
 middlesex new zealanders and the american 4 2 mortar company were forced to withdraw five miles to brigade reserve during 
 the night everything became rather confused due to the fact that forward elements 0:ele 0:ments of the i 18 ccf 
 division had started to infiltrate with the tail end of the retreat ing 6th rok division who were straggling past 
 our positions by 0700 hours 24 april elements of the 118 ccf division penetrated to the base of the mountain 
 to the rear of battalion hq and b company was ordered to move to a hill feature 0:fea 0:ture at 
 the rear of the battalion this move was carried out under protection of continuous 0:continu 0:ous air strikes against the 
 enemy who by this time were quite close each man in addition to his own fighting load approximately 60 lbs 
 carried either three 60 mm mortar bombs or a 250 pound box of mmg ammunition up an almost vertical hill 
 when the crest of the hill was reached the chinese forces were already 0:al 0:ready at the base so no 
 time was lost in descending 0:des 0:cending to bhq where water bottles were filled from a small stream and climbing 
 on up to the new positions which were reached about 1400 hours all day the enemy were visible and by 
 1600 hours they could be seen streaming along 0:a 0:long the tops of nearby hills and down to the assembly 
 areas the defensive positions were far from ideal no barbed wire entanglements no mine fields most of the trenches only 
 knee to waist deep due to the hard shaly ground morale was high and the general feeling appeared to be 
 one of tension building up for an all out fight at approximately 2100 hours the enemy opened up on b 
 company with heavy mortar fire which lasted about 15 to 20 minutes 0:min 0:utes then under guidance of tracer machine 
 gun bullets 6 platoon was attacked this platoon had spotted and reported the enemy forming up for an attack on 
 the middlesex 0:mid 0:dlesex 6 platoon was assulted four times and called on battalion mortars to support them the company 
 section of mmg plus brens simulating 0:sim 0:ulating mmg fire and 5 platoon s small arm fire kept the chinese 
 from pressing their attack the enemy then swung his force around to the east of 6 platoon s hill for 
 an attack on battalion hq this attack was stopped cold by the 50 and 30 calibre machine guns of support 
 company i ncldentally it might be worthwhile to mention at this stage that they were prepared to fire in any 
 direction on a moment s notice 
 the patrician 22 earlier at 2200 hours the chinese attacked 0:attack 0:ed d company with a very heavy force 10 
 and 12 platoons bearing the brunt of the attack both platoons had sections overrun but by withdrawing their sections into 
 a tight perimeter 0:peri 0:meter around their platoon headquarters they managed to hold out 10 platoon had so many enemy 
 swarming over their positions that they photo by the albertan the lady patricia ramsay with her equerry capt r x

 germany on 8 9 october 1954 
 the patrician 23 called down their own artillery on their own positions which inflicted terrific casualties on the enemy and 
 enabled them to hang on here we will pause and review the situaion 0:situa 0:ion at about 0400 hours 25 
 april the battalion supply route had been cut by the enemy at 0300 hours 24 april and the troops were 
 existing on what they carried in 3 hours before b and d companies by 0300 hours 25 april were running 
 out of ammunition 0:ammuni 0:tion and the battalion reserve was almost gone the 81 mm mortar platoon was running 0:run 
 0:ning low and they had been carrying over 2000 bombs by dawn 25 april they had approximately 0:ap 0:proximately 10 
 bombs left the men were dead tired as they had almost 0:al 0:most no sleep or rest for 48 hours 
 since 0600 hours 23 april and in addition had used up most of their energy climbing steep hills and digging 
 defensive positions in fact b company had dug two complete defensive positions in 24 hours this was the situation when 
 the commanding 0:command 0:ing officer sent the following message to brigade hq 250400 hours battalion surrounded in need of supply 
 air supply requested at 1030 hours 25 april four cll9 s dropped the supplies what a heartening sight that was 
 to tired hungry troops who knew they were just about out of ammunition and still surrounded by the enemy i 
 doubt if any feat performed by the u s a air force was ever applauded so sincerely and with such 
 shall we say colourful 0:colour 0:ful language then came the air evacuation of the seriously 0:seri 0:ously wounded which was 
 completed by 1200 hours this was done by helicopter using a landing strip perhaps 30 by 75 yards hemmed 0:hem 
 0:med in on three sides by steep valley walls and on the fourth by a high tension wire the less 
 seriously wounded were taken out by jeeps through scattered chinese small arms fire by now the sth calvary regiment of 
 the ist cavalry division had arrived and by i 100 hours a heavy artillery bombardment in front of b company 
 s position began at 1300 hours they put in an attack by nightfall they had gained a substantial toehold and 
 the battalion 0:bat 0:talion was warned for a withdrawal the next day at 1630 hours 26 april the battalion was 
 relieved by the 2 bn 5 rct ist calvary division 0:di 0:vision and withdrew unmolested at 1400 hours the battalion 
 established a defensive position to the right of seoul and started digging 0:dig 0:ging in the next morning 28 april 
 the battalion along with our american 4 2 mortar support company moved off to the youngpyong rest area there everyone 
 had a chance to sleep eat and wash and clean up equipment author s note this article was written to 
 explain from a soldier s point of view the battle of kapyong 0:kap 0:yong it has been done as truthfully 
 and as simply as the writer knew how perhaps some will say it was under written perhaps some will complain 
 that they were left out but as i stated at the beginning of this article this dealt not with the 
 individual but with the battalion anyone wishing a more detailed account of any particular phase will find many veterans in 
 the battalion for a more bloodthirsty 0:blood 0:thirsty version three drinks in any canteen or mess will get you a 
 tale that will leave you shell shocked trooping the colour ppcli becomes the first canadian regiment to troop the colour

 the patrician 24 in memoriam late captain robert x swinton mc it is with deepest sorrow that the regiment records 
 the death on 16 october 1954 in a motor accident in germany of captain r x swinton mc whilst serving 
 with 2 battalion born in lethbridge on 4 april 1918 he enlisted in the seaforths 4 september 1939 and served 
 throughout world war 2 with that unit he was commissioned on 5 march 1942 and was awarded the military cross 
 for his part in the ijssel river operation on 11 april 1945 he retired with the rank of captain on 
 10 october 1945 then on formation of the special force in 1950 he enlisted as a captain and served in 
 korea with 2 ppcli on return from korea in 1952 he qualified as a parachutist and commanded c company 2 
 battalion in may 1953 he crossed the atlantic and represented canada in the coronation contingent all ranks regret the loss 
 of this very fine regimental officer depot report approached repeatedly by the editor during 0:dur 0:ing the past week as 
 to when the depot s contribution 0:con 0:tribution would be ready i place my pen to this paper finding a 
 suitable topic always presents a bit of a problem but there is a subject that is worthy of any report 
 major h g munro 0:mun 0:ro the commanding officer of ppcli depot as he is a reserved man it is 
 foreordained that he will object to the appearance of this article it is also known however that more senior patricia 
 officers will happily sanction it and no doubt their decision will prevail he is the son of the late lieutenant 
 colonel 0:col 0:onel w a munro dso who commanded bth battalion 90th winnipeg rifles during world war i he enlisted 
 as a trooper in the royal canadian dragoons in april 1927 and served with that regiment until june 1934 tired 
 of brushing horses tails and combing manes his services were offered and accepted by ppcli posted to a company winnipeg 
 he became prominent in athletics and represented 0:represent 0:ed the regiment in boxing soccer and physical 0:physi 0:cal training he 
 climbed the hierarchical scale to the rank of company sergeant major and proceeded overseas in 1939 as csm of c 
 company commissioned in april 1941 he served in the sicilian and italian campaigns posted to the school of infantry in 
 camp borden in 1946 he served with 3 ppcli in 1951 and has held a t appointments in winnipeg and 
 halifax in september 1952 major munro arrived in calgary to assume the position as secretary treasurer of the newly organized 
 regimental executive committee 0:com 0:mittee a committee designed to administer for the benefit of the regiment as a whole all 
 regimental non public property and funds the position as secretary treasurer called for initiative and ingenuity for there had never 
 been a predecessor and the ground was fertile for new ideas at this time i ppcli was in korea 2 
 ppcli was the home battalion 
 the patrician 25 and it is the members of this battalion who will recall the major squeezed in a little 
 corner 0:corn 0:er of the administration building for space was at a premium dialecticaly preparing the way for the return 
 of the first battalion with both battalions stationed at currie barracks for the first part of 1953 he encouraged 0:en 
 0:couraged diplomatically that the one thing greater than a battalion of ppcli was the regiment full of regimental spirit his 
 beliefs 0:be 0:liefs were emphatic and his decisions always impartial always for the regiment one of the first jobs was 
 to tabulate record 0:re 0:cord and to redistribute the regimental property 0:pro 0:perty this was followed by the task of 
 organizing 0:organ 0:izing the central fund which took over the control of all monies of each battalion this demanded the 
 attributes of not only an accountant 0:ac 0:countant but also those of a person well versed 0:vers 0:ed in keeping 
 financial records major munro proved to be more than a good diplomat and financial expert for on i june 1953 
 he was appointed commanding officer of ppcli depot with this appointment 0:appoint 0:ment he not only assumed the resonsibilities of 
 a co but pursued with measureable success 0:suc 0:cess some regimental undertakings for which we should all be grateful he 
 has revived the printing of the regimental journal the patrician 0:patri 0:cian and as editor has earned many praises the 
 third volume of ppcli history largely through the efforts of this personage is now being written by the regimental historian 
 lieutenant colonel g r stevens this volume will be on the market by the fall of 1955 the patricias enjoy 
 a museum rsm gardner 0:gard 0:ner the curator has made it one of the finest 0:fin 0:est through the cooperation 
 and assistance of the commanding officer of the depot the organization of christmas parties for dependent 0:depend 0:ent children is 
 not an isolated case of his concern for the welfare of a patricia orderly room the orderly room staff along 
 with some distinguished and pretty civilians is composed 0:compos 0:ed of sgt penner j r orderly room sgt and cpl 
 senecal j m l what s going on in the depot orderly room lots of work 7 hrs 40 mins 
 a day of it then we have the nights to complete the less important details are we busy always 0:al 
 0:ways if not all we have to do is sit around and let capt swick see us are we busy 
 always we are waiting for our inter communicaton system but in the meantime we hope that our issue of roller 
 skates comes in in order to travel from the orderly room to the adjutant s 0:ad 0:jutant 0:s office sgt 
 penner left for his annual leave 12 oct cpl senecal taking over the precious duty of orderly room sgt well

 0:motion to corporal regimental police a peeq at 9 in addition to the issuing of clothing and equipment we are 
 responsible for the provisioning 0:pro 0:visioning of barrack and training stores on top of this we are also responsible as 
 part of the housekeeping unit for all buildings in the garrison on charge to ppcli when no battalion of the 
 regiment is present at the home station it is a general opinion held by most people outside of q that 
 members of the q staff do no work and are charter members of that organization known as the forty thieves 
 this is a downright lie a perfect example of the conscientious untiring people employed 0:employ 0:ed in our domain is 
 lt hutt our quartermaster 0:quarter 0:master he has worked so hard in the past year that he lost all his 
 friends and had to get married for companionship he then spent some time in hospital still on crutches because 0:be 
 0:cause he ruined his knee begging borrowing 0:borrow 0:ing and stealing pardon i mean scrounging stores required by the depot 
 it has been rumoured unjustly that the q stores are forming their own chapter of alcoholics unanimous but this is 
 untrue our members are just so considerate and sociable that they hate to hurt a man s feeling 0:feel 0:ing 
 by refusing a drink our demon adjutant capt swick has at various times hinted that we spend too much time 
 on our coffee breaks his opinion is based on the fact that every time he comes near the stores on 
 the scrounge naturally he finds us having coffee he does not realize that we vary our coffee periods to coincide 
 with our work load 
 the patrician 26 numerous requests have been made by the adjutant for an intercom system for the depot 0:de 0:pot 
 this would be an unnecessary expense to the taxpayers god bless em because with his fine parade ground voice we 
 can hear him in the basement even though he is on tho top floor we sometimes feel that we are 
 not liked or appreciated because the only time anyone speaks to us in a friendly manner is when they are 
 completing a period of engagement and want their clothing credit money toute de suite during the world serious the q 
 office 0:of 0:fice looked more like a bookie joint with that sharp clothing credit accountant fred wright running as many 
 as five pools at once we think but cannot prove that the pools were crooked because fred won twice we 
 think that it is time we stopped complaining 0:com 0:plaining and gave some useful information for the benefit of all 
 those little monsters pardon we mean dear recruits who contemplate 0:con 0:template going awol don t because as of i 
 oct 54 you do not receive clothing credit allowances that is 10 00 per month for the time spent on 
 the loose the regimental band when the last issue of the journal was going 0:go 0:ing to press the band 
 was busy preparing for a grand concert in aid of the garrison church choir to be held in the auditorium 
 of currie school this concert was given on 7 april with the help of artists from the various 0:vari 0:ous 
 church choirs in calgary a large crowd attended and the offerings of the band and artists were well received during 
 the week of 10 may we turned out with the various units in the garrison for the goc s inspections 
 another ceremony we enjoyed 0:en 0:joyed very much was the queen s birthday parade carried out by the ist battalion 
 queens own rifles of canada on 24 may the band was also in attendance at the queen s mess dinner 
 in the evening during the periods 7 june to i i june and 21 june to 25 june the band 
 played a series of open air concerts in edmonton these concerts 0:con 0:certs proved to be very popular with the 
 public and we received good notices in the local papers on 16 july we packed bag and baggage for victoria 
 to start training for the ceremony of the opening of the british empire games we were stationed with the navy 
 at hmcs naden along with the naden band the rcaf band from edmonton and the band of the rccs from 
 kingston we thus embarked on a two week session of hard work and a lot of laughs at the same 
 time the hard work was in preparation for the intricate massed band display the laughs were caused by the army 
 and airforce bandsmen trying to get used to the seemingly peculiar ways of navy life you can still hear some 
 of them saying that they are going ashore looking for their cabin and putting things on the deck although inter 
 service relations took a severe strain at times it all ended well and we look back to our stay at 
 the naden with fond memories after the opening night of the games we were one of the two service bands 
 who were on duty all through the games we were very fortunate to see all the exciting events including the 
 canadian boat team beating the english and the miracle mile after all the excitement and late hours we were ready 
 for leave on our return home from vancouver on i 3 august on 17 september an interesting engagement 0:engage 0:ment 
 was carried out for the service of the archbishop of canterbury in edmonton we were honoured to receive a letter 
 from the archbishop complimenting us upon our performance 0:per 0:formance the big day of course was the trooping the colour 
 ceremony held on i october first battalion this year had the services of the regimental band congratulations are in order

 continually like the eagle renew 0:re 0:new its youth as new members are taken on and the old guard fades 
 into the background the benefits enjoyed by patricia s at the front during three wars should not be forgotten and 
 this should be handed 0:hand 0:ed on to the next generation of fighting 0:fight 0:ing troops by those whose fighting 
 days are over the regimental journal the patrician 0:pat 0:rician should receive the unqualified support of our association a great
