 western canada he lived with great personal sorrow and hardship he made mistakes he was devoted then he was put
 on trial and driven away samuel trivett was born in england in 1852 and was expected to follow in his
 father s footsteps of wine making or tea blending family tradition has it that samuel had a sensitive pallet and
 was expected to be a wine taster or tea taster however a foreign missionary bishop from the wilds of british
 north america came within earshot of the young boy he responded to the words of william carpenter bompas bishop of
 athabasca and offered himself for training in the ministry of the church of england he went to the church missionary
 college at islington near london and was ordained deacon and priest in 1878 both ordinations are generally separated by the
 space of a year but since samuel was going west where a bishop was not always present he was ordained
 deacon and priest within a shorter period of time sam had married and he and his wife left england july

 good whaleskin riven boat which as the days wore on the physical condi would be greatly superior to a conventional
 tion of the men their stamina and competi boat for the crossing tive spirit began to manifest itself the flotilla
 started to string out for hundreds of the eskimo camp was located the boat miles thomas burry was almost always
 in owner was there and a deal was started the the lead although dr reason did take first eskimo could
 not speak english but he was place occasionally jim pottinger was very a hard dealer when the deal was over
 tom steady and was very close on their heels had paid a very high price for the boat sometimes they
 would not see each other to his consternation he found that the deal for days and one time when tom
 felt he did not include the oars and the eskimo had far out distanced them he was sun ran another
 very hard deal for them this prised one morning to see them passing be boat is handled in the river
 with a large fore he had broken camp paddle like device called a sweep tom had not included this in
 the deal according to one late afternoon on the mackenzie they the eskimo although tom thought he had were caught
 in a storm and headed for tom was really angry about having been shore as quickly as possible tom and
 his taken so completely by the eskimo so made partner dougal jumped out of their boat up his mind that
 somehow he was going to and were fighting to steady it as it was being get that sweep without being
 gypped further pounded on the shore by the waves when an indian appeared from nowhere grabbed he gestened that there
 were too many an axe and felled a large log which he rolled people around but pointed to the northunder
 the boat as they pulled each time a north east when the sun reached there wave struck soon the boat
 was teeter which would be about 2 a m everyone tottering easily on the log saved from the would be
 asleep and toni would give him 22 not all klondikers were successful in their trek to the yukon above is
 a boatload of them on peace river in 1899 returning to edmonton a bottle of whiskey the eskimo agreed and
 the boat later proved itself to be all the left the sweep outside his hut at about font mcpherson factor
 said it would be and nmidnight tom quietly retrieved the sweep tom was ever grateful for his advice and and
 he and his companion pushed off they concern it was tough and was able to take lmad gone about a
 mile when they saw a the abuse from striking rocks it had two kayak push off from camp and quickly
 head long shafts out the rear like handles of a for thenm it overtook them easily when wheelbarrow its bottom
 was mostly flat tlme eskimo got close he paddled expertly slightly rounded and it had some flexibility with one lmand
 he was grasping something when they ran onto a submerged sandbar with his other hand which was inside the they
 could work the two rear handles vigorkayak and he obviously meant business ously and the boat would crawl in the
 shal the only way out was to grab the 38 55 low water like a snake after many weeks rifle
 and keep him covered so he could not of work and struggle they reached a lake at do anything violent
 as a mix up would the summit they crossed the lake and have meant drowning the eskimo grasp found a
 place where the needs and bulled the side of the wlmaleskin boat with rushes were leaning and slightly bent water
 his paddle hand and then there was a very was flowing into a very small stream the long stalemate while
 the boats drifted in other way complete silence the strain was terrific tom had no whiskey but he did have
 a a tremendous load was lifted from them bottle of essence of ginger which looked for these were the headwatens
 of a tributary very impressive he said to his companion of the porcupine which flowed into the for goodness sake
 hurry and find it and yukon river as they drifted down the give it to the eskimo the eskimo grabbed
 small stream it narrowed the banks got it without taking his other hand out of the higher soon they were
 within vertical walls kayak then he pushed off and was gone the stream took a quick turn too short a
 this was their most harassing experience radius for their boat and they jammed 23 solid they were wondering what they
 were in the air they knew there was a small ingoing to do when they noticed the water dependent trader
 ahead who had set up on rising behind them the boat had dammed the riven bank a few years before
 and deand restricted the flow of the water sudden cided that this may be a good place to spend ly
 the whaleskin flexed the boat lifted and winter they were made welcome by the they shot downstream in front of
 the crest trader and arranged things as comfontably the whaleskin had again demonstrated its for themselves as possible bad weather

 as the days wore on the stream got boats made it to the post sonic had lost better the days
 were shortening but the most of their provisions and the stock at weather was holding one day as they were
 the post was small there was some undrifting an indian ran out on the shore pleasantness and some disagreement and
 it waving and yelling white man him die looked like a troublesome winter ahead they had heard rumours that some
 of the indians were slightly hostile and they one morning when tom got up the thought the man was threatening
 them and weather seemed somewhat improved and telling them they were going to die tom he said to dougal i
 think there are other yelled to dougal to hit for midstream while places better than here let s make a
 break he got close to his rifle as they were pulling for it pottinger noticed their activities and away tom
 said i believe that indian is asked what was going on he said tom friendly and he is trying to
 tell us some if you are going to try to get further then thing they went ashore the indian was
 so are we dr reason imiade the saimie deindeed friendly a man had died on the cision later the few
 boats broke camp on river bank perhaps in 1897 the indian the porcupine and headed toward the had found some
 of his gear bits of clothing yukon river the weather held for a couple and his bones he had buried
 the bones of days but they knew that winter could with gravel and rock they could not find not be
 far off enough to establish identification al par an orange was seen bobbing up and ently he had died alone
 down in the backwater the men in the one fine day shortly thereafter tonm and whaleskin retrieved it it was
 partly bad dougal decided to take the day off and fix and had probably been discarded by a and iimmprove
 some of their gear dougal steaimien which was plying the yukon later was attending the fire which was producing that
 night wlmen time three boats made camp the orange was divided almmongst all present smoke and tom was a short
 way off gather and they really thought they had a good ing pitch and resin in the long grass he
 saw treat a man peeking at the camp and stalking towards the smoke cautiously the man had for these three
 boats the battle of the not seen toni and he was carrying a rifle back door route was over they
 had tom decided the way to handle this was a broken through to the yukon valley and had double stalk
 so he stalked the stalker tom established coimimunications with other men was delighted to recognize his friend jim and the
 outside world there was even pottinger and saw humour in his caution postal service along the yukon river they toni
 pounded his hands together and went were sobered by the thought of the many boom jim hit time dirt instantly
 and did boats that they knew would be caught by not show his head until he heard toni winter along
 the peel the rat and the porlaughing jim had seen the smoke from up cupine like soldiers who had broken
 river and as there were rumours of hostile through a heavily defended line they were indians he decided not to
 pass without troubled by the thoughts of casualties which caution they knew would lie behind them several days downstream the
