 4 the patrician 2007 colonel in chief message from the colonel in chief the right honourable adrienne clarkson pc cc 
 cmm com cd my dear patricias i am deeply honoured to provide the opening remarks for this year s patrician 
 2007 was a very memorable year i was absolutely delighted to assume my duties as your colonel in chief and 
 thank everyone for their kind words wonderful hospitality and support i will begin my comments by thanking lady patricia for 
 her service and her counsel lady patricia served as colonel in chief for 33 years travelling from england to visit 
 with the regiment 45 times over the course of her tenure she redefined the role of the colonel in chief 
 actively supporting ppcli operations and training and establishing a close personal relationship with the regiment that has no parallel i 
 was extremely happy to see this outstanding service and dedication formally acknowledged when lady patricia was awarded the meritorious service 
 cross by her excellency the governor general in august the regiment remained focused on operations in afghanistan a company from 
 the second battalion and c company from the third battalion bravely and selflessly upheld the regiment s fine traditions of 
 service and sacrifice under very trying circumstances sadly nine patricias were killed by improvised explosive devices in two separate incidents 
 in june and july i was very privileged to attend the repatriation ceremonies for these fine soldiers as they returned 
 to canada these solemn rites were marked by quiet professionalism dignity and compassion as the regiment pulled together to support 
 the families and friends of the fallen the regiment maintained its resolve in the face of these tragedies successfully completing 
 the mission and redoubling its efforts to prepare for future deployments i visited all of our battalions over the course 
 of the year in march i saw the first and third battalions in garrison in april when i attended the 
 90 lh anniversary of the battle of vimy ridge i attended private herbert peterson s interment ceremony with the loyal 
 edmonton regiment and in september i visited with the second battalion and the operational mentoring and liaison team during their 
 pre deployment training in wainwright i was also fortunate to have the opportunity to visit with the patricias serving in 
 the canadian army s important training institutions my visits to the french grey battalion the land force western area training 
 centre and the canadian manoeuvre training centre were very interesting and informative john and i thoroughly enjoyed the ppcli association 
 s 60 h anniversary celebrations in calgary in august we were very happy to see so many patricias come together 
 to celebrate an important milestone it was an excellent introduction to the association and a terrific opportunity to visit with 
 patricias and their families and reminisce about the regiment s accomplishments i also enjoyed my visit with the atlantic branch 
 at the end of september i appreciated the memorial ceremonies held at each of these events to honour the memories 
 of the patricias who passed away and commemorate the important contributions made by the regiment s veterans i am very 
 proud of the regiment s accomplishments over the past year and extremely grateful have the privilege to serve as your 
 colonel in chief and support your important work i look forward to the opportunity to sharing more experiences and deepening 
 my relationship with the regiment in the months and years ahead yours faithfully adrienne clarkson colonel in chief 
 the patrician 2007 5 colonel of the regiment by any and all measures 2007 was an extraordinary year for our 
 regiment first and foremost was our success meeting our afghan campaign tasks a company second battalion and c company third 
 battalion served with great distinction in battle groups based on battalions of the royal canadian regiment additionally numerous members of 
 the regiment served often in action in afghanistan either as individuals or as soldiers with the special operation forces command 
 early in the year second battalion formed a battle group with soldiers from the third battalion and reserve force units 
 across western canada and began an intense year of preparation leading up to deployment in early 2008 the first battalion 
 trained an infantry company to provide force protection for the provincial reconstruction team meanwhile third battalion assembled and trained an 
 operational mentoring and liaison team omlt for deployment in 2008 this two hundred soldier unit largely consists of ppcli troops 
 reinforced by soldiers from other regiments and branches of the canadian forces the omlt s mission is to liaise with 
 and support the operations and training of the afghan army brigade in kandahar province the omlt is made up of 
 small teams that serve side by side with the afghans starting at rifle company level the afghans are brave soldiers 
 who fight well but they lack the essential support elements and training necessary for tactical success against the taliban the 
 omlt is intended to address these shortfalls during the year a number of patricias won gallantry awards or awards for 
 notable service during operations we are all proud that their gallantry and service have been recognized unfortunately we sustained casualties 
 with nine patricias killed and several others wounded in action within the limits of our resources we continue to support 
 the families of our fallen we also actively monitor the care and progress of our wounded as they recover while 
 our focus was on operations and training we also marked another first in our regiment s history as we changed 
 our colonel in chief changing our colonel in chief set a number of important precedents the right honourable countess mountbatten 
 of burma lady patricia to our regimental family our colonel in chief for almost thirty three years felt that she 
 was no longer capable of performing her duties in a manner acceptable to her to that end she sought and 
 received permission to retire from her majesty queen elizabeth 11 colonels in chief traditionally do not retire their appointment is 
 for life the regiment conscious of lady patricia s desire to retire began to search for a new colonel in 
 chief lady patricia supported this effort and it was decided that a canadian lady would be the best candidate to 
 serve as our third colonel in chief the rest as they say is history my predecessor major general robert stewart 
 approached the right honourable adrienne clarkson our former governor general and commander in chief and asked if she would consider 
 the appointment her response was both immediate and enthusiastic madame clarkson has a direct family link to our regiment through 
 her husband mr john ralston saul john the noted author is the son of colonel william saul a regimental officer 
 he grew up in the company of the regiment s leaders including the founder brigadier a hamilton gault mr saul 
 s godfather was brigadier rowan coleman a ppcli officer who won the military cross at leonforte later commanded the loyal 
 edmonton regiment in italy and served as the president of the ppcli association from 1965 1970 with the demands of 
 operational training the exercise close battle professiona development symposium was used to concentrate members of the regiment in edmonton for 
 training in march the training coincided with the planned handover between the lady patricia and madame clarkson the handover took 
 place on 17 march with guards and colours from the three battalions and the loyal edmonton regiment on parade a 
 series of highly successful and enjoyable social events involving all ranks took place before and after the parade to celebrate 
 the handover the regiment was superbly supported throughout these activities by all levels of the army especially the members of 
 the edmonton based units of 1 canadian mechanized brigade group and land force western area the change of appointment handover 
 concluded at the end of august when her excellency the right honourable michaelle jean presented the meritorious service cross to 
 lady patricia in recognition of her outstanding service to the regiment and canada and the ppcli association voted to appoint 
 madame clarkson as their patron the 60 th anniversary marked another very important and successful milestone as over 400 patricias 
 family and friends gathered in calgary to commemorate the regiment s accomplishments in the coming year many of our soldiers 
 will be in afghanistan actively engaging a ruthless and resilient foe i ask that you do whatever you can do 
 to support them and their families while they are serving our country brigadier general j e l gollner retired colonel 
 of the regiment 
 6 the patrician 2007 message from the regimental major major e a liebert cd the theme of this year s 
 patrician is service change and the way ahead 2007 was a busy year the regiment continued its tradition of service 
 contributing rifle companies to support two royal canadian regiment rcr battle groups supporting the expansion of canadian operational mentoring and 
 liaison team operations in kandahar and working closely with headquarters schools and training establishments to pass on the lessons learned 
 in afghanistan the ppcli association continued its commitment to service marking an important milestone when it celebrated 60 years of 
 service to the regiment and canada 2007 was also a year of change and transition this was particularly true when 
 the regiment celebrated the change of its colonel in chief 2007 was also a year of preparation and anticipation as 
 the regiment prepared to mount another major deployment to afghanistan princess patricia s canadian light infantry is still fighting a 
 war against a ruthless and determined opponent fortunately the regiment remains committed to ensuring that its soldiers are prepared for 
 the challenges they will face overseas the regiment s focus remains on afghanistan and the challenge of promoting security governance 
 and development in the face of an insurgency and the cumulative effects of thirty years of armed conflict a company 
 from the second battalion and c company from the third battalion served with consecutive rcr task forces in afghanistan both 
 of these companies enthusiastically embraced the challenge they were given and worked hard to improve conditions in their area of 
 operations this was not an easy undertaking sadly the regiment was reminded of the dangers inherent in this mission when 
 nine brave patricias from c company were killed by improvised explosive devices in two separate incidents on 20 june and 
 4 july 2007 the highlight of the year was the colonel in chief change of appointment ceremonies the regiment s 
 attention turned to edmonton in march when lady patricia formally relinquished her appointment and madame clarkson assumed her new duties 
 and responsibilities as our new colonelin chief 0:colonel 0:in 0:chief all three patricia battalions the loyal edmonton regiment and the 
 old guard paraded with their colours to bid farewell to lady patricia and welcome madame clarkson to the regiment the 
 final stage in the handover process occurred in august when lady patricia was awarded the meritorious service cross by her 
 excellency the right honourable michaelle jean to recognize her 33 years of loyal and dedicated service to the regiment and 
 canada over 400 members of the ppcli association gathered in calgary to pay their respects to lady patricia and welcome 
 madame clarkson as their new patron attention shifted back to afghanistan in the fall as the regiment prepared task force 
 1 08 for overseas operations this was a regimental undertaking with all three patricia battalions and the loyal edmonton regiment 
 contributing soldiers to the second battalion battle group the operational mentoring and liaison team and the provincial reconstruction team patricias 
 also played a leading role in designing the challenging field training exercises used to prepare these soldiers for the challenges 
 they will face in afghanistan this issue of the patrician is dedicated to everyone who contributed to this effort is

 16 the patrician 2007 the regimental museum and archives the regimental museum and archives by lt zivkow sa greetings from 
 the military museums it has been a busy year not only with the amount of visitors coming down to the 
 ppcli gallery but also with the expansion of the museum itself the museum will be recognized as a tri service 
 museum because the air force and navy museums of alberta are moving into the newly built addition this will draw 
 a new crowd of visitors to see all the changes being incorporated into the combined establishment with this being said 
 like all good military plans phase 2 of the project is underway this will see the existing office space and 
 archives being moved to the new addition and the old space being renovated what does this do for the ppcli 
 museum staff it will give us more room for storage and a better set up to properly record and preserve 
 artefacts donated to the regiment the only drawback is the temporary office space for the operations side of the house 
 with the reduced space several items regimental history documents have to be placed in the basement which will cause minor 
 delays in responding to requests for information over the past year the acting curator for the ppcli gallery wo ron 
 gallant has been busy ensuring forecasted repairs to the gallery are being dealt with in a timely manner including applying 
 for grants to assist in the funding of museum projects sgt bruce graham the archivist for the ppcli gallery a 
 senior nco who wears several hats has been busy logging in new artefacts almost daily and constantly watching every auction 
 site across the globe to see if any historic ppcli artefacts come up for sale this might seem like an 
 easy task however if it s a historic item that belongs in our museum and the bid is due at 
 3 am another recent change saw capt rick dumas selected for the omlt tf 1 08 and hastily deployed for 
 the tour lt steve zivkow is holding down the museum side of the house until rick s return future changes 
 to the ppcli gallery are in the planning stages some of the equipment and displays will be changed to enhance 
 the gallery s appeal other additions including an afghanistan display will soon be up and running the museum needs your 
 support to develop the regiment s displays the staff are looking for information photos and artefacts to improve the afghanistan 
 and balkans displays don t throw out your old tour fmp s badges maps tee shirts cool tour stuff donate 
 it to the museum include your stuff as a part of the ppcli history please don t mail yourself from 
 all the museum staff thanks for all your support 
 the patrician 2007 17 regimental veterans care with this being our first year in existence we managed to survive the 
 steep learning curve and actually keep our feet on the ground for those of you who may not be aware 
 the regiment established the regimental veterans care rvc cell in the fall of 2006 to assist the growing number of 
 injured and wounded soldiers returning from operations the rvc cell currently consists of two ncos within the framework of the 
 regimental headquarters rhq whose task it is to provide a link between our wounded and the chain of command coc 
 by establishing this link mcpl monty robson and wo pete palmer are expected to keep the regiment s leaders advised 
 on the condition of our wounded and help identify any lapses in support to them conversely by staying in touch 
 with these soldiers we are responsible for providing them accurate information to ensure they can take full advantage of all 
 support agencies both within the canadian forces cf and those external to the cf this also means we have to 
 stay current on what each support element provides and the numerous changes to cf policy dealing with the care of 
 the wounded we do this by meeting with the key personnel from agencies such as veterans affairs canada vac operational 
 stress injury social support osiss director of casualty support and management dcsm service income security insurance plan sisip and cf 
 medical case managers to name a few in order to keep abreast of what is available and policy changes similarly 
 by participating in events such as the casualty support lessons learned symposium and a variety of medical transition working groups 
 we are able to provide a soldiers perspective to the cf health services when we began our work in the 
 rvc cell we commonly dealt with injured soldiers who had little knowledge of the cf medical services we are pleased 
 to report that the situation is improving most of the soldiers who deployed to afghanistan received training on what happens 
 when a soldier is wounded on the battlefield we are working hard to ensure our soldiers have access to the 
 information and services they need i would like to sign off with this final message just as every soldier s 
 individual actions make a difference on the battlefield so to can their actions make a difference here at home by 
 passing on the word that care is available and ensuring that no soldier should suffer in silence we can help 
 each other and avoid needless suffering if we don t know that a soldier needs our help we can t 
 do anything about it just as we support each other during operations we must support our injured wounded with their 
 recovery the coc will do the right thing if they are asked so please encourage those that may be in 
 need of help to step forward and seek it if the regiment didn t care then there wouldn t be 
 an rvc cell we are here so please let us help the regimental veterans care cell can be reached by 
 phone at csn 528 5546 or by 780 973 4011 ext 5546 we are located within the rhq offices which

 was a busy one for the red devils with an upcoming deployment of fellow patricias a company became a major 
 training and support element the first major exercise of the year was the combat team commander s course where 1 
 ppcli provided the manoeuvre elements for the validation of new company commanders a company worked hand in hand with artillery 
 and armoured elements to provide a realistic training exercise for this course at canadian manoeuvre training center cfb wainwright this 
 exposed the new platoon commanders to company level operations while allowing the soldiers of 1 ppcli to begin focusing or 
 individual soldier skills again post combat team commander course the company moved onto summer leave in august after summer leave 
 the red devils deployed on adventure training to banff alberta with a batch of new soldiers it was an excellent 
 bonding experience for the new troops with conversation during the roac move ranging from music to unmentionables the five day 
 exercise included outdoor sports ranging from spelunking to mountain biking to white water rafting the exercise went off with out 
 a hitch and all soldiers involved had fun exercise desert ram tf 1 08 assembles to assault survey hill cfb

 the horizon and 1 ppcli was a major support element for preparing its brethren from the 2 nd and 3 
 rd battalions ppcli to go overseas it began with two weeks of sandbag duty along with range construction when this 
 stage was complete range 25 in wainwright resembled a small piece of afghanistan in mid september task force 1 08 
 arrived in wainwright and the exercise began the red devils were ready for them providing mounted and dismounted range safety 
 along with actors to play afghan locals the three week exercise was an eye opener for all the new soldiers 
 and a chance for all to learn operational lessons during exercise desert ram the red devils received three brand new 
 platoon commanders from combat training center cfb gagetown the three new officers were quickly integrated into the company and quickly 
 found themselves befriended by all ncos who began the task of finishing the new officers training when the exercise came 
 to a close the leadership had firmly cemented their relationships well trained strong good at what we do flexible forward

 it was a busy time in the lines with all the soldiers either taking or teaching courses the red devils 
 still found the time to honour their fallen along with the rest of the ist1 st battalion for remembrance da 
 with a small ceremony in the lines a company also sent soldiers to speak in schools across alberta it was 
 a job well done with 1 ppcli receiving praise for the manner in which soldiers conducted themselves along with the 
 messages conveyed with their courses complete in early december and christmas leave coming up soon the three platoons welcomed more 
 new soldiers into the fold fresh from their basic infantry qualification course 2008 holds a lot of promise for the 
 red devils and all hope it runs as smoothly as 2007 exercise desert ram red devil inn bravo company exercises 
 desert ram and maple guardian played host to many units from across canada for task force 1 08 s pre 
 deployment training serial these two exercises also gave the newly formed kandahar provincial reconstruction team kprt the opportunity to come 
 together in the field for the first time b company 1 ppcli is scheduled to travel with the kprt on 
 task force 1 08 as the exercise desert ram cordon and search on range 25 
 the patrician 2007 29 ivp integral force protection element during the months leading up to exercises desert ram and maple 
 guardian b company took every chance they got to help develop other elements of the kprt in convoy operations anti 
 ambush drills and all other infantry specific fields the predeployment 0:pre 0:deployment exercises gave b company the opportunity to run 
 through many complex operations alongside other kprt elements such as the psychological operations team and the civilian military cooperation teams 
 cimic throughout the course of the exercises b company participated in platoon company and combat team level live fire ranges 
 these complex ranges were coupled with many other dry and live fire scenarios that tested both the soldiers and the 
 leadership of b company physically and mentally exercise desert ram occupying survey hill over the course of both exercises b 
 company not only helped bring the kprt up to speed with their mounted and dismounted drills the company came together 
 as a team itself before deploying to the field on exercises desert ram and maple guardian b company was augmented 
 with a platoon of reservists this addition brought b company up to two lav platoons and one defence and security 
 platoon in preparation for the upcoming mission to afghanistan the reservists from the defence and security platoon received training on 
 the rg 31 giving them the convoy escort capability this capability gives the company added versatility in terms of keeping 
 pace with the current operational tempo in afghanistan exercises desert ram and maple guardian were excellent stepping stones for b 
 company toward its deployment on task force 1 08 the exercises allowed the company to fine tune its drills as 
 well as establish an excellent working relationship with the other elements of the kprt exercise desert ram artillery barrage prior 
 to the of battle group assault 
 30 the patrician 2007 ivp 2007 was an unforgettable year for c company 1 ppcli the year was marked with 
 trials tribulations sorrow and happiness after christmas leave came and went the troops were ready to start off the year 
 knowing that there were quite a lot of challenges that lay ahead of them since this i year was the 
 year to get another cycle of troops ready for deployment to afghanistan there was no i shortage of training exercises 
 for them i charlie company afghan national army actors on exercise desert ram almost immediately primary combat function course cycles 
 were in full swing and many ncos were double tasked as instructors and students all the while looking after their 
 peers and subordinates during everyday battalion routine the focus for the year was getting b company read to go to 
 afghanistan after christmas of the following year and to get the remainder of the battalion fully trained for rotation 03 
 09 2007 was also the year that c company was part of the biggest range training facility ever built surprisingly 
 enough the live fire ranges encompassed a wealth of training value to better prepare our troops for deployment combined arms 
 teams joined together to apply heavy suppressive fire to seven mock villages artillery barrages hit closer to home than anticipated 
 on a few occasions tanks lav ill s high explosives heavy support weapons and the fighting efficiency of the soldiers 
 on the ground made for an outstanding show of force there was no doubt in the minds of all military 
 members involved that exercises desert ram and maple guardian were huge successes anc impressed all command levels b company was 
 training hard to go over as an attachment with 2 ppcli for rotation 01 08 they were cycled through exercises 
 desert ram and maple guardian and were considered amongst the best trained most professional troops to run through range 25 
 this was shown by the r hard work dedication and desire to succeed exercise maple guardian was in full swing 
 immediately after exercise desert ram and command was relinquished to canadian manoeuvre training centre so they could develop their troops 
 and experience what it was like to use combined arms to their full capabilities almost in the blink of an 
 eye silly season was among us and there were many activities taking place in c company the soldiers christmas dinner 
 was a huge success as was the combined mess dinner for senior ncos and officers the hockey game this year 
 was fun filled and action packed 
 the patrician 2007 31 ivp aggression on the ice the only major incident that took place on the ice was 
 the co of the battalion getting pulled into the senior ncos bench area this was apparently a better year for 
 the officers who only lost 8 12 as the troops from c company set off on leave there was a 
 sense of relief and sentimental nostalgia taking place many ncos were leaving the battalion for good leaving many close friends 
 and comrades behind to set off for new endeavours many people were also saying their farewells to friends from b 
 company that were leaving soon for afghanistan right after christmas leave despite the busy routine hard work and dedication of 
 the troops this year for c company was quite the memorable one one that will shape the success of many 
 of the new troops who joined us forever combat support company 2007 was a very busy and exceptionally productive year 
 for combat support company the company took part in a wide range of exercises and conducted a variety of courses 
 undoubtedly helping to keep their skills and capabilities sharp for future challenges co and rsm 1 ppcli help at the 
 60th anniversary steam line reconnaissance platoon kept busy in april and may instructing a basic reconnaissance course while the senior 
 platoon members were busy teaching this year s candidates the troops worked hard providing a difficult and cunning enemy force 
 their experience and hard work was paramount to the success of the course which finished with a 95 success rate 
 next the platoon took part in exercise patricia wolf which involved a night range consisting of section live fire with 
 lav 111 stab runs in september and october of 2007 reconnaissance platoon participated in exercise prairie ram which had them 
 involved with a variety of tasks with the inclusion of several ranges they also held soldier for a day working 
 with civilians who were interested in what army life is like on top of that work load they also managed 
 to find the time to conduct a driver wheel course and conduct some rappelling they immediately moved into exercise maple 
 guardian running through october to november during the exercise they were involved as observer controllers and drivers assisting the battalion 
 in training the soldiers involved with task force 1 08 signal platoon was no less busy than the rest of 
 combat support company this year the platoon participated in three exercises over the past year exercises mech mithras desert ram 
 and maple guardian consistently helping to keep the battalion with good communications throughout they ran two army tactical communication and 
 information systems operator atcis courses out of their platoon lines helping soldiers to become communication qualified as well they supported 
 two 
 32 the patrician 2007 ivp atcis courses run out of 3 ppcli when not teaching atcis courses several soldiers were 
 involve with teaching on advanced winter warfare and lav 111 gunner courses signal platoon also managec to find time in 
 their demanding schedule to further their own skills with journeyman primary land qualification and remote control improvised explosive device rcied 
 courses still other soldiers were busy acting as drivers for the numerous tasks required in both wainwright and edmonton when 
 they could find a moment many soldiers were involved in public relations events at schools remembrance day ceremonies and young 
 offenders centres speaking on afghanistan and life in the canadian forces 1 ppcli snipers held their own though under an 
 equally heavy workload they began the year by running a basic sniper course from may through august the great amount 
 of knowledge and experience was obvious as the course finished with a 93 success rate following the course was the 
 next challenge the 2007 canadian international sniper concentration involving four newly qualified snipers 1 vp teams finished respectfully and gained 
 a good deal of experience and knowledge from the event fall 2007 proved a difficult time as several soldiers were 
 posted to new positions and units the cell then received five new snipers from throughout the company and carried on 
 with the next task the snipers supported exercises including a pacific exercise in british columbia involving other army units and 
 exercise maple guardian both of which helped the sniper cell to develop new skills and enjoy new experiences exercise desert 
 ram defence against counter attack during the occupation of survey hill the soldiers of combat support company also took part 
 in various remembrance day ceremonies i the month of november the company enjoyed the christmas celebrations in december and a 
 well deserved period of leave the soldiers of combat support company are looking forward to the future challenges of the 
 year to come administration company 2007 was a milestone year for administration company upon return from afghanistan the battalion resurrected 
 headquarters company hq split between the traditional administration and combat support companies officer commanding oc headquarters company maj george boyuk 
 ran both organizations as virtual companies under one commander the first task of the year was support to 1 canadian 
 mechanized brigade group s 1 cmbg exercise strong contender the 1 cmbg annual sports activity 1 ppcli was tasked to 
 coordinate the exercise from opening ceremony to closing ceremony this very important war fighting task was given to administration company 
 for the usual reasons the contest while very hectic for the platoon commanders and 
 the patrician 2007 33 ivp seconds in command running a sports operation center or soc pronounced sock was seen as 
 a success by the brigade it is surprising that we were not condemned to do it forever following a relatively 
 gentle primary combat function cycle the company quickly geared up for the handover between lady patricia and madame adrienne clarkson 
 supporting various ceremonies and events following that the company began the massive task of supporting the combat team commander s 
 course in wainwright with maintenance platoon attempting to create a taj mahal entirely from i canvas supporting lav llls leopard 
 tanks companyotes badgers and all the various b vehicles each with its own bizarre variant kept the maintainers very busy 
 despite robust augmentation from other brigade units the bivouac fell under control of wo todd d andrade nominally company quartermaster 
 sergeant cqms of combat support but in fact acting company sergeants major a csm hq company who tackled the job 
 in his normal enthusiastic manner and soon became known as the gatekeeper of the out route as soon as the 
 gagetown people left it was time to tear down the bivouac drive 300 km and set up again in suffield 
 the road move in itself provided ample opportunity for maintenance platoon to recover vehicles that found the hills of the 
 badlands somewhat taxing on the other hand the maintainers were able to exact revenge by rear ending a lav 111 
 from b company with a husky recovery vehicle while the rifle companies were busy setting things on fire administration company 
 literally settled down lower and lower into mud as thick as molasses second in command administration at the time then

 ground was a lot softer and the battalion had picked the one fortnight a year it rains in suffield on 
 the other hand maintenance platoon became very skilled at recovery under austere conditions a csm d andrade found the suffield 
 in and out routes easier to police because vehicles deviating from the track plan soon became high centred and culprits 
 could not run very fast in ankle high mud for all the kitchen chairs sunk in the mud capt wright 
 was eventually forgiven moved to operations promoted and will soon return to the company as oc summer posting change around 
 happened early for the command team maj boyuk said his farewells to the company just after suffield and left for

 platoon commander 3 ppcli and wo bill armand reserve support staff governor general s foot guards for six months these 
 three patricia soldiers lived and fought along side afghan and coalition soldiers in the province of kandahar as the name 
 suggests the primary mission of the omlt is to train mentor and assist the afghan national army ana to bring 
 peace and stability to afghanistan and although the focus of the omlt is to train the ana in order to 
 produce a professional and creditable fighting force for the government of afghanistan goa the primary function of the r 3 
 omlt personnel was to plan and execute combat operations and provide combat enablers to the ana it was a very 
 demanding experience that tested the combat skills initiative and patience of all involved however despite its challenges the omlt task 
 proved to be an extremely rewarding experience during r 3 the canadian contribution to the nato omlt initiative expanded dramatically 
 it grew from one infantry kandak battalion and key staff mentor positions at the brigade and corps level to include 
 almost an entire ana brigade four of five kandaks and key positions at the corps level this expansion is a 
 huge commitment that will undoubtedly change the role of the canadian forces in afghanistan for the foreseeable future and will 
 be key for afghans providing their own security wo armand lcol eyre and capt thompson

 was faced with many challenges and changes throughout 2007 the year began with support to the primary combat function pcf 
 courses and the basic reconnaissance patrolman course in kamloops bc this was followed by a major shake up of both 
 administration and combat support companies the stand up of the task force 1 08 omlt meant an end to 3 
 ppcli s combat support company as the lead force generator for the omlt only signals platoon and the military police 
 section remained administration company accepted these personnel warmheartedly 0:warm 0:heartedly and thus became known as headquarters company hq hq company 
 was first tested as a new organization in the field during exercise tere kawel hq company was able to bring 
 all support elements together to successfully support the omlt s training while conducting contingency planning in response to the possible 
 floods in the lower fraser valley in response to the c company casualties hq company was tasked with providing assisting 
 officers to the family members of the fallen and dealing with the matters in the edmonton area although these events

 supporting family members despite the many training stands conducted by b company hq company provided them with the support needed 
 to assist 1 ppcli s training plan upon completion of exercise desert ram hq company prepared and supported the fall 
 pcf cycle which ran from october to december capt gord macleod and wo ken surridge formed the hq company command

 has driven an intense pace of training and operations in 2007 we trained and deployed 127 c company personnel and 
 the commanding officer with the task force 1 07 suffering the loss of nine comrades but as always enhancing the 
 third battalion reputation for warrior spirit courage and professionalism simultaneously the battalion force generated and trained initially sixty omlt personnel

 ppcli and elsewhere 3 ppcli has deployed 174 personnel on task force 1 08 following the tour a company will 
 be reconstituted and will support 3 ppcli as it force generates the task force 3 09 omlt and fills other 
 essential operational tasks in the task force third battalion certainly had a busy operationally focused year with moments of joy

 the patrician 2007 63 original patricia 1246 sergeant frank smith brown frank smith brown was an authentic original patricia he 
 joined the newly forming regiment as a private soldier at lansdowne park ottawa on the 26 th of august 1914 
 he was twenty one years of age married with a daughter isobel velma brown the family residence was the manse 
 in almonte ontario a few miles north west of ottawa prior to the outbreak of war frank brown had nine 
 months of service with the royal canadian regiment and three months with the royal canadian engineers at st jean qc 
 on enlistment he gave his occupation as a soldier and a clerk he was 57 tall with a 35 chest 
 that was typical of the recruits of the period frank brown served with the regiment through the training at levis 
 qc and at tidworth england where he earned his sergeant s stripes he went to france with the regiment arriving 
 there a few days before christmas 1914 sergeant brown entered the trenches with his rifle company on the night of 
 6 7 january 1915 and served in the mud rain and cold until he was killed in action at st 
 eloi on the 3 february 1915 sergeant brown like so many youths of the time had a good grasp of 
 the basics of english grammar and appears to have been a well read soldier his early schooling had been in 
 waterford simcoe county where the basic three rs were emphasized in the school curriculum before his death in the trenches 
 at st eloi he wrote a poem about mail that ended up with the port elgin times which published it 
 later in 1916 here is a copy of the original publication mail what is the call the bugle the call 
 that has no betters the silver call that beats them all the music call for letters you can take a 
 silver trumpet and sound the dread alarm t a will spring to action with his rifle neath his arm but 
 if you want to see him jump or run like a streak of hail just take the same old bugle 
 and sound the call for mail his hand is all a tremble his eyes stick out like pegs he goes 
 all of a quiver from the ague in his legs and if his name s not on the list he 
 wilts like a frozen bud until another mail call drags him ploughing through the mud now the moral is for 
 folks at home don t wait for him to write and don t just say dear tom must close i 
 hope this finds you right a good long newsy letter is the best that you can yield in the way 
 of down right service to your tommy in the field what is the call the cheering call that every other 
 betters a silver call a longed for call the music call for letters

 clippings in scrapbook passed down through the generations in a friend s family i was using the scrapbook as source 
 material for two other patricias the geddes brothers who served through vimy ridge and passchendaele more on their service at 
 a later date the countess of mountbatten s own legion of frontiersmen was founded in 1904 by roger pocock a 
 former member of the north west mounted police the legion of frontiersmen is an international service organisation dedicated to promoting 
 loyalty discipline and good citizenship and providing assistance particularly during emergencies and times of conflict the legion of frontiersmen provided 
 volunteers to the ppcli and the 49th edmonton battalion during the first world war and eventually formed the 210 frontiersmen 
 battalion of the canadian expeditionary force no formal affiliation exists between the ppcli and the legion of frontiersmen but the 
 two organizations share a connection through lady patricia who serves as their patron

 66 the patrician 2007 vp in uniform janet hayward my sister janet hayward is a closet poet and wrote the 
 attached poem a few years ago in honor of my father that served in the armed forces and is now 
 retired to make a long story short she resides in vancouver and has been asked by the military to read 
 this poem to my dad james hayward at the canada place ceremonies on the 11 th of november 2007 his 
 father served in the second world war and his grandson my son james hayward arnal returned from afghanistan after six 
 months in february of this year so you can see how war and peace continues to have an impact on 
 my family the poem has a profound meaning for those associated with the armed forces and i think would have 
 meaning to others it shows just how members of the armed forces feel about protecting our country the sacrifices they 
 make and the impact they have on their families and the pride the families have for their fathers husbands brothers 
 and sons and nowadays mothers wives sisters and daughters but most importantly that they never forget remembrance of those that 
 have given the ultimate is honored daily for soldiers through the many symbols she mentions wendy hayward in uniform standing 
 tall eyes focused forward rigid against the background of a platoon of soldiers medals adding colour to the dark bleak 
 uniform decorating the man for his commitment his bravery and his service to his country a bead of sweat falling 
 the sun soaking into the black asphalt beneath his boots the ceremony remembering those who have fallen and friends to 
 have served yet passed on eyes marked with lines of the years gone by of serving others of the pride 
 felt to belong to this select group of individuals who have given a part of themselves and their families his 
 straight back his rigid chin his focused eyes his expressionless face for most a symbol the image seen throughout the

 for both iraq and afghanistan a composite company of 6 rifles exeter returned from afghanistan in may 2007 and a 
 composite company of 7 rifles reading london is currently serving in afghanistan the high operational tempo has given the new 
 and young regiment a true baptism of fire and has helped to bind it early on in its existence through 
 common operational experience hardly a patrol or convoy in all the operational theatres returned to base without having had some 
 sort of contact or fire fight often at uncomfortably close quarters employing every weapon in the armoury including hand grenades 
 having returned to base they were then additionally exposed to intense mortaring testimony to their steadiness under fire is the 
 excellent basic and pre operational training they get before deployment since forming on the ist1 st of february 2007 we 
 have had 8 operational fatalities and an uncomfortably high casualty rate with severe injuries and loss of limbs sight and 
 other lasting damage which will require life long support and aftercare the rifles as a large large regiment offers all 
 ranks greater career opportunities there are now 7 commanding officers slots 7 regimental sergeant major slots 70 odd warrant officers 
 posts in the region of 110 colour sergeants slots plus a high proportion of ring fenced extra regimental appointments far 
 more than any of the individual forming regiments could offer previously officer recruitment is going well the large large regiment 
 with 5 regular battalions and 2 territorial battalions offers very many more and varied career opportunities than single battalion regiments 
 did previously riflemen recruiting is holding up well here we value in particular the important county regional and most importantly 
 family loyalties and connections that the forming regiments have brought with them and which we are keen to nurture individuals 
 will continue to move between battalions as career moves on promotion or request or as the exigencies of the army 
 requires the colonel in chief of the rifles is hrh the duke of edinburgh each battalion has a minor royal 
 as their battalion royal colonel the freedoms of cities towns and boroughs of the forming regiments have been carried forward 
 as have all affiliations and alliances at home and overseas the merger and amalgamation of the four proud regiments forming 
 the rifles with a history and traditions stretching back to 1685 has not been without same pain and sadness however 
 all the serving elements of the forming regiments have come together very willingly and are very keen and proud to 
 be able to adopt the ethos and traditions of the riflemen the rifles look to the future with confidence and 
 anticipation and with the support of the old and bold of their forming and antecedent regiments we will succeed the 
 motto of the rifles is swift and bold

 now ski and snowboard on mount washington it was 30 march 1951 the snow was deep it was freezing cold 
 and the welcome wagon was not there to greet us fortunately resistance was relatively light i weighed about 155 lbs 
 in those days carrying about 55 lbs of equipment including a rifle grenades rations and an old wwii army blanket

 to climb fight and capture the mountain on behalf of all servicemen who served in korea we are humbled and

 84 the patrician 2007 ere kingston patricias another year has come and gone with perhaps the most unusual aspect being 
 that lcols mary makulowich shane brennan and bryan bailey managed to find themselves together at royal military college rmc on

 the patrician 2007 85 ere patricias leading the way at canadian forces leadership and recruit school cflrs sgt a j 
 mcconnell it has been another productive year for the patricias posted to the canadian forces leadership and recruit school cflrs 
 in total there are 20 patricias posted to cflrs with the majority of them primarily functioning as instructors some are 
 employed as section commanders and others as platoon warrants or commanders mwo kevin lewis is the sergeant major of c 
 division no matter what the title our nco s on the ground at cflrs are performing with the highest level 
 of professionalism and pride in true patricia fashion our guys here who are instructing are continually looking for and implementing 
 wherever possible ways to improve the training plan with regard to both recruit and junior officer leadership training for example 
 this year saw the first use of the ch 147 griffon helicopters in support of a recruit course s final 
 exercise in the field wo yon kalben who is a platoon commander for a recruit course co ordinated with his 
 sister platoon and our local 438 squadron and was able to conduct the week long final exercise while incorporating the 
 two helicopters that were provided the platoons were inserted into the training area and conducted link ups before moving to 
 their respective forward operating bases which have been built in the area over the last two years the recruits conducted 
 a number of missions with the support of the griffons and finished the week which turned out to be the 
 highlight of their course in a similar initiative sgt geoff nevill and sgt alex hon organised a final assault to 
 sum up their recruits field training which made use of the farnham areas small but better than nothing urban operations 
 training area with a view toward evolving the training plan further an initiative is being put forward by mwo lewis 
 to expand the urban operations site this would not only support the scenario based training which is now heavily embedded 
 into the field training portion but would also allow the schools combat arms personnel to sharpen their skills on a 
 regular basis in addition i put forward this year a proposal for cflrs to purchase simunition equipment to be used 
 in the final field week of recruit and officer training simunition is a product much like paintball which allows the 
 soldier to use his own weapon to train sgt ross weaver has one last farewell salute 
 86 the patrician 2007 ere recently been recognised with a canadain defence acadamy cda commendation he is continually working to 
 improve the standard of training taking place and his constant suggestions up the chain of command in order sts neville

 invaluable mwo lewis also received a cda commendation for his excellent work in the organisation of the vimy ridge 90 
 th anniversary parade which involved over 500 hundred recruits 100 veterans and dignitaries he also sits on the board for 
 the military family resource center and is a constant support for the families of the patricias at the school he

 87 the patrician 2007 ere shaw worked extremely hard this year to make his vision of a canadian forces cf 
 club which would offer training in a variety of martial arts to anyone interested it has been a bumpy road 
 to start but the end of 2007 saw the official stand up of the spartans martial arts club the club 
 required the creation of an executive committee led by sgt shaw the president and joined by sgt weaver sgt weibe 
 mwo lewis and sgt mcconnell the goal is to expand the club across the cf to a number of bases 
 the club s first major event was an exciting night which saw the spartans with the help of sgt geoff 
 nevell and sgt dwayne macdougal rappel face first into cflrs team wins general dellaire challenge 4th year in a row 
 sgt mcconnell graciously says goodbye to lady patricia

 of a few and posting in of more those who left were wo joe stang sgt james o neil and 
 the always famous cpl frank monaghan we miss you in the vault frank the next 12 months will be busy

 the base headquarters hq staff the majority of ppcli soldiers in suffield work out of the g 3 range control 
 operations cell the patricias are split between two field operations sections fos fire crews and are mixed in with other 
 combat arms personnel from various units throughout the country the fos s main role is to fight and put out 
 the many grass fires that occur during the british and canadian training which takes place in suffield from early spring 
 until fall during the high threat fire season of mainly july and august the crew may deploy to one of 
 three field stations close to the on going training in order to cut down on the deployment time for fighting 
 
 90 the patrician 2007 ere the fires this is important due to the massive size of the training area where 
 it might take more than one hour just to drive out to the fire from range controls location in addition 
 to the fos personnel there are several personnel who work in the range control operations centre their duties involve the 
 command and control and overall safety of personnel traveling and working in the training area due to the enormous amount 
 of training and other activities going on the operations centre can be a very stressful and demanding job on even 
 the most veteran junior nco during the fall a lot of maintenance takes place in the training area with repairs 
 fencing and disturbed land the patricias supervise and assist in a training area wide range sweep conducted by the british 
 at the end of their training serial for the year during the late fall our work shifts to focusing on 
 wildlife and hunting patrols cfb suffield is a protected area and the large number of elk deer and antelope on 
 the base may prove tempting to some people but we deter their temptations the rest of the year we keep 
 up on with our personal fitness training as well as personal soldier training such as the battle fitness test personal 
 weapons test and other base defense training so from the all the patricias in suffield have a great and exciting 
 year and hopefully we will see you all in our neck of the woods if we had any woods in

 91 the patrician 2007 braun family visits korea visit to korea mrs patty braun our journey to kapyong began on 
 22 august 2006 that day the world stopped turning as we learned my son and children s brother corporal david 
 braun was killed by a suicide bomber at kandahar afghanistan the braun family at kapyong korea when we attended a 
 memorial service for david at shilo i noticed the ppcli building had a sign in front of it that said 
 kapyong barracks prior to david going to afghanistan i had read a book about the history of the ppcli i 
 recalled that kapyong was a significant part of the regiment s history in particular 2 ppcli as she had been 
 planning before david s death my daughter daina and her boyfriend scott left in january 2007 for kangnung south korea 
 to teach english i had decided that i would visit her the following summer and asked my sons chris and 
 michael to accompany me since we were going to be in korea i thought we should go to kapyong i 
 was put in touch with captain rob mcconechy and asked if he could help me find the best way to 
 get to kapyong from seoul he responded informing me sergeant leanne st jean from the canadian embassy in seoul would 
 escort us to kapyong this was much more than i expected these military people really deliver 
 92 the patrician 2007 braun family visits korea on a rainy 4 august 2007 myself daina chris michael and scott 
 found our way there are no street signs or numbers to the canadian embassy in seoul we were met by 
 sergeant st jean and driver mr kirn in the pouring rain what should have been a three hour round trip 
 to kapyong took six as a result of holiday traffic as we arrived at kapyong the rain miraculously stopped the 
 kapyong memorial is a beautiful tribute to our canadian soldiers especially 2 ppcli who were so instrumental in the kapyong 
 battle sergeant st jean showed us the hill where the patricias were situated during the battle it was hard to 
 imagine the lush green hills devoid of their foliage showing bare rock and dirt sergeant st jean also showed us 
 the school attended by students who are recipients of a ppcli bursary we are very honoured that david was a 
 member of 2 ppcli and it s proud history at kapyong our visit was an important part of our korean 
 experience thank you captain rob and sergeant leanne 
 the patrician 2007 93 association president s report since being elected the president of the ppcli association many challenges have 
 been put to council and with a new executive who are just getting their feet wet it is amazing what 
 they have done the ppcli association is in good hands and we are working hard to keep it that way 
 with the knowledge of the present executive i believe that we will meet all the challenges and accomplish our aim 
 as we prepare for another point in our history of the regiment the 100 th anniversary in 2014 for the 
 association it will be a challenge and a lot of hard work by the members of council membership and the 
 executive with the dedication of the membership and council we will prevail in preparation for the 100 th many proposals 
 have been put on the table by the regimental executive committee rec and as we progress the plan is intensive 
 the executive and the members of council have made great strides on a number of issues that face the association 
 my dealings with council have been very positive we have a plan for the future of the association it is 
 somewhat difficult to explain all the work and the involvement that the executive and council have taken on since taking 
 office i have attended three rec meetings and during those meetings the association has been a topic of discussion and 
 during those discussion we as an association have received our share of accolades from the serving component for what a 
 great job we are doing as an association with the projects we are managing vpp program op small pack the 
 hgmf to name a few are all association programs plus many other projects we have taken on we still have 
 some hurdles to overcome the major one being membership the membership committee is working hard to increase our membership however 
 it is up to our members to sell our association and recruit more members they are out there and we 
 need their support we must also close the gap between the serving component and the association and be more visible 
 we must build and expand our branch membership before we as an association venture into projects and tasks for the 
 100 th anniversary we must have all our ducks in order and the membership must be briefed fully and so 
 they understand what lies ahead at the annual general meeting agm in victoria in late august i will brief the 
 membership on all the on going activities and all sub committees will be given time on the agenda for their 
 presentations once a patricia always a patricia bert scott president ppcli association bert eleanor scott at the 60th anniversary

 who make these training events even more enjoyable the core of regular staff at the army simulation centre remains ron 
 bragdon and dave pentney while jay lapeyre retired after his twelve years with the centre we were all greatly saddened 
 with the untimely death of captain mathew dawe who many of us watched develop into a fine young man and 
 officer while growing up with some our own siblings here in kingston the outpouring of affection and support to the 
 dawe family continues with contact to the family and his courageous widow tara and son lucas we also maintain contact 
 with cynthia hess yon krudener and she has been a welcome member of our association the branch is looking forward 
 to increasing our membership 20 growth this year and building on the great work started by louis and heather grimshaw

 support to us and their community local projects in support of our 100 th will commence in earnest this year

 dancing itself gloriously into the new day s light reflecting the awakening of canada light dances unto its folds like 
 the many personalities it has befriended its grey shades in remembrance of those who have given the supreme sacrifice reaching

 cloud because we are on the march again in 2008 wainwright branch wainwright has become nearly unrecognizable for those ex 
 patricia types who haven t ventured into east central alberta recently you would be stunned by the changes in both 
 the camp and the town the camp s quaint world war ii atmosphere is now entirely erased there are new 
 married quarters that actually look like real houses a state of the art weapons effects simulation and training facility increased 
 staff major improvements to infrastructure and the training area the town now boasts a population of 5 300 a wal 
 mart supercentre a canadian tire boston pizza and a tim horton s but you will be pleased to learn that 
 there are still only two stop lights and that strange stop sign you have to drive around in the centre 
 of town this past year has been an active one for the wainwright branch with many of our local members 
 continuing to support and participate closely with our serving comrades whether it is through the corps of commissionaires the western 
 area training centre the canadian manoeuvre training centre or camp wainwright itself ken ryan dave macdonald mwo payette and the 
 colonel in chief 
 108 the patrician 2007 association the komindinas bill miller bert scott dave macdonald john smith lady patricia and the colonel

 of new members join our ranks including mwo kevin kehoe jack barber dave macdonald tom little and sgt james lavallee 
 we also experienced a couple of leadership changes after ten plus brilliant years as branch founding president and now our 
 new national president bert scott handed over the reins as president to bill miller unfortunately for us bill decided to 
 move to pierceland saskatchewan and after a hard fought leadership battle paul mansbridge emerged victorious the branch continues to enjoy 
 the opportunity to support the battle school did i say that i meant the lfwatc of course as the old 
 guard representative for six recruit badging and graduation ceremonies fred goldring from the edmonton branch came out twice while bill 
 miller wally komodina bert scott and john smith each attended once in april we were able to make the branch 
 a little cash by providing security one evening for the annual wainwright buck n brawl an indoor rodeo event that 
 sees some of the countries top cowboys come out and take a run at this years rough stock later in 
 the spring we had the good fortune to able to meet our new colonel in chief when she visited wainwright

 branch members and their significant others enjoyed the excellent food and danced well into the evening 
 the patrician 2007 109 southwest ontario branch again as in the past few years our annual general meeting was held 
 in the howard johnson s hotel in st catharine s during the weekend of 4 5 may 2007 changing from 
 the past we held the meeting commencing at 1330 hours on saturday followed by our meet and greet clearly the 
 president was concerned over excessive drinking prior to the meeting not that the branch isn t well behaved especially with 
 wives in the vicinity but we are patricias after all the principal item of new business discussed was the 100 
 th anniversary project and the membership was presented with a new idea by bruce paxton and john hunter that will 
 in the branch s opinion go a long way towards renewal and continuance of our association the dinner was held 
 on saturday night with some forty two in attendance our guest of honor for this occasion was master corporal glenn 
 hall and his wife glenn served in croatia with second battalion and was presented his governor generals commendation by jack 
 palmer who as many of you know served in the regimental signals platoon during the italian campaign glenn was delighted 
 when he also received a ppcli lapel pin to remind him of his time with the colours we don t 
 make enough of a fuss over our tradesmen sometimes but boy are we sure glad to see them when they 
 show up in the freezing cold to fix our broken down vehicle or tow us out of where we shouldn 
 t have been in the first place the usual suspects we received a few well chosen words from doug armstrong 
 on his trip to the rededication ceremony at vimy ridge he was impressed with the ceremony itself and the obvious 
 concern displayed by our governor general doug also laid the association wreath at this year s armistice day ceremony at 
 the cenotaph in st catharine s the final event of the evening was a presentation to bruce and leda paxton 
 for their efforts over the years in support of our branch enough cannot be said to both of them for 
 their caring concern and dedication we wish them the best on the way ahead jack palmer ww ii regimental signals
