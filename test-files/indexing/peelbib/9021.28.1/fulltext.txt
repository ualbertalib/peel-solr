 much of the alberta demonstrated in their command of irri land made available to settlers was to prove unsuitgation techniques
 how admirably even a group able as the base for a small family farm but in with apparently alien values
 could fit into the 1905 the idea of growth founded on such a unit plan for a peaceful and orderly
 society was well established indeed triumphant the per iod of stuggle had begun times might be hard and rewards limited
 for the pioneer but the struggle could be won disillusionment was to come later two models for the new western
 polity wert thus in conflict in the alberta of 1905 for the moment the battle lines were obscured by the
 over riding preoccupation with growth to the homesteader growth meant a rapid end to his isolation adequate access to expanding
 markets and the provision of the level of cultural amenities and governmental services to which his own background inclined him
 to aspire to the elite already in place and to the newcomers who by reason of particular professional skills or
 available capital reinforced their ranks growth meant enlarged opportunities to practise those skills or invest in the new province and
 room for two conflicting social ideas though in retrospect it seems obvious that the relationship of alberta and indeed of
 the west at large to central canada was that of a colony of its metropolis there was little disposition to
 question the distribution of powers in the federal structure or even the degree of control over the west s development
 implied by the retention of the natural resources of the west in federal hands the elite were disposed to see
 themselves as colonizers not as colonials and their access to opportunities for investment as secured by their role as the
 agents in the west of the central establishment like the cattle interest the generality of the elite kept their communications
 with the centre in good order the elaborate network of family business educational religious and personal ties that has held
 the canadian establishment together was never in better working order words like establishment and elite must so loor or to

 laurier at left refuses to give the new provinces their natural resources the influential minority in touch with their fellows
 in other canadian regions were not likely to reject the political structures that ensured the canadian relationship the construction of
 a new polity in the west was the greatest achievement of the post confederation conservative administrations the first years of
 laurier liberalism happened to coincide with the quickening of the pace of western development the influential soon found that they
 could accommodate themselves to the new regime the liberals were temperamentally more committed to the philosophy of growth and certainly
 more disposed to accept the ideal of a society based on the small family farm the alberta farmers in 1905
 including the homesteaders who were flocking into the province had no be applied with extreme caution in any discussion of
 alberta s social structures less highly coloured words like influential and managerial are much safer references to ‘‘ class are
 even more treacherous alberta before 1914 did have a social structure but it was a community almost wholly made up
 of immigrants many of them recent arrivals the structures in existence at the turn of the century reflected the aspiration
 of the influential minority of eastern canada and particularly of ontario to these aspirations manyof the immigrants before and after
 1900 could easily relate if there was something in their background which made them congenial this something might be a
 matter of education social position or simply a highly individual perception of the nature of the good life though congruity
 of aspirations was no guarantee of material success it did reinforce the group which constituted the influential minority of alberta
 the newcomer might largely share the latter s values though as time passed they might also dilute and modify them
 reason to suppose that they could not work through the liberal party to promote their interests it seemed niuch more
 accessible to advocates of policies acceptable to farmers organizations than its conservative predecessors it was liberal legislation after all that
 had brought the two new provinces into being if they noted that laurier stood firm on the retention of federal
 control over western land and resources and fought his hardest battle to maintain some vestiges of the rights to denominational
 education and to the use of the french the chief reason why no ‘ i ‘ 1 i language this
 does not seem to have affected albertans might lay claim to being a classless their vote in 1905 the vast
 majority of alberta and egalitarian society but the journalistic satire voters in 1905 did not seriously question either of a

 providing an ample shade continued archdeacon lloyd as to whether the for the eyes during these warm days in sunny
 average british settler or the doukhobors were alberta one notices too the prevalence of the best people to bring to

 country well i am willing to admit that for one who has not seen calgary for several the first year
 the doukhobor is of more value to canada inasmuch as the result of his labor is years is amazed at
 the number of handsome buildings of calgary s own sandstone most soft more immediately felt than that of the english
 and agreeable to the eye and most hard and durman the second year they are more nearly equal able for
 all practicable purpose when it is added and in the course of three or four years the that there are
 now in the city no less that 12 doukhobor is nowhere in comparison so far as chartered banks and 73
 wholesale houses the his general usefulness as a citizen goes reader will readily believe both in the existence in conclusion
 i may say that it is quite possible of numerous fine buildings and in the supremacy that lloydminster may become
 in time more than exercised by calgary over the surrounding couna local centre for this new district there is good
 try of course as in every other western town timber a few miles to the north and underneath the most
 of it has been done since the new century forests coal is believed to lie and there are in began

 had opened branches here then coal mines that will swell the little town to the they all came with a
 rush range of an industrial city but these are things of the future what is certain at the present time
 is the assessment of the city shows its progress that the barr colony of 1903 is prosperous and from year
 to year in 1896 it stood at 1 994 300 contented here around lloydminster in 1906 and slowly crept up

 after some initial problems the cladonald settlers were very successful in alberta not the the first thing about farming of
 that the man on the separator got from 5 00 to 20 a more anon day according to the outfit
 the man on the as i have said we started the harvest at 4 00 engine where he was not
 the owner of the outfit per day for the stooker but hardly a week had drew his 10 to 25
 aday cooks were paid 8 00 gone by when the wage rose to 5 00 and then to l 2
 aday forcedtopaytheseexcessivewages shot up to 6 00 and even 7 00 and some of the the threshing outfits charged the
 farmer from 13 big outfits toward the end of the season were to 17 cents per bushel paying 8 00
 a day to the stooker when the cost of putting in harvesting thresh it is a fact that the farmer
 could not make a ing and marketing that crop is taken into account profit and pay such prohibitive wages the
 result one wonders what there was left for the farmer s was that many of them clubbed together and work
 grain has an inclination to strike the toboghelped each other to harvest their own grain gan just as harvesting ends
 and with the shortage some of the farmers left their grain unstooked in of cars always at this season and
 the uncertain the field declaring it would be cheaper not to weather which makes the hauling of the grain to
 thresh then pay such wages motoring over the elevators anything but a comfortable job the country we saw fields and
 fields of unstooked farmer deserves our sympathy grain lying on the ground and in every instance while threshing was in
 progress came emisthe farmer asserted that he was unable to get saries from the war veterans association from stookers save
 at the prohititive wages mentioned the cpr from the government and from other above nevertheless during that period the fraternal
 and charitably inclined associations streets of calgary were thronged with idle men who made a farm to farm canvass on
 behalf of the and the government employment office was full english harvesters soliciting homes and posiof men waiting for jobs
 to be called at the wages tions for the men who crossed the sea to hardemanded many a farmer went
 up and down the vest your crop for you streets personally soliciting the men and offer that is what they
 said to the farmer that was ing the highest wage he could afford to pay without a distinct loss their
 preachment and part of their propaganda the facts were that they the government and came the threshing the previous year
 bundle the railroads had brought these men to this throwers had been satisfied with 4 00 per day country and
 no doubt had made promises of and board this year they demanded and got winter employment at all events many
 of the 6 00 and some outfits paid 7 00 and 8 00 men assured me that this was the
 case they took the solution of the problem of caring for the men son s work to lay off for
 the entire winter to the already overburdened farmer and they first of all i might recall the fact that this
 is an pointed out to him that here was an opportunity to agricultural country the cities afford only have good
 strong workers at a lower wage then limited employment and they should therefore that paid experienced hands be eliminated in
 considering possible places of just here i might point out that an inexperienced employment hand on a farm or a
 ranch often costs in losses most people cherish the erroneous notion that from incompetence and ignorance far more than farming
 is a simple occupation that anyone can his wages could pay for as an instance i might undertake that requires
 no brains no apprenmention one englishman who was a perfect dub ticeship no experience no especial gift that is about
 tools and implements i don t believe he a most fallacious idea farming properly conknew a screw driver from a
 wrench and every ducted is as skilled and important a business as implement upon the farm was a plough to
 him any that exists the farmer indeed needs both nevertheless he acquired a passion for hammers knowledge and skill in
 a hundred directions in and he would hammer and bang everything into fact if a man desires to go in
 for farming in this the shape he thought it should be with the result country it would be well for
 him first to go to that an astounding number of implements were work for another farmer and learn his trade
 too most perniciously bent and injured another eng many come out here take up a homestead or buy lishman who
 had averred that he was used to and a farm go out upon the land and then blunder understood horses
 put to work at summer fallow along helplessly till they are either broke or have ing used the ingenious method
 of stopping his won out the most successful farmers here are horses by pulling at their tails and calling those
 who either started in the service of another whoo a a the horses took fright and were farmer or who
 have had experience elsewhere soon off in a bad runaway three horses with before coming here badly skinned shins against
 a barbed wire fence a next to farming the lumber camps offer pertwisted and partly broken disc and an englishman
 limping ruefully home with a sprained ankle haps the best opportunities for employment the which laid him up for a
 week or two were the net camps are unable to get anything like the labour result of this adventure they
 want the work is healthy and the hours are regular it is of course hard and husky work however this
 is all part of the game we but many men prefer it to any other type of are not hard
 on the men who make these kind of physical labour in some camps modern applimistakes through ignorance and we know
 that ances are afforded there the men have bathing often the greenest tenderfoot will sometimes turn facilities and are given
 clean quarters and good out the best of workers once he has learned his bedding the lumberjacks and loggers demand
 job and get the best of grub but to come back to the solicitation of the work in the coal
 mines is hard and not farmers to take in the english harvesters for the especially pleasant but it is well
 paid for i winter after the harassing events of the summer believe the wage is from 8 00 to 20
 a day and above mentioned it may be thought that mr it is fairly regular employment there will likely farmer
 would turn a deaf ear to these canvassers be a considerable development of the mines in for the men from
 the old land far from it the the coming years as alberta is being recognized result was quite remarkable if
 one takes the as a great coal country and only time and capital figures of the railroads and the government
 into are needed to bring it up to a producing centre consideration fifteen thousand homes and posi that will compare
 with that of other coal countions secured for 12 000 men that was the trem tries endous response of the
 canadian farmer i am told by railroad official heads that there is i am told that out of the 12
 000 men who came here only about 1 000 returned to england in our always work on the railroads in
 a big country like this railroad construction goes on constantown district of calgary 300 positions on farms were found for
 men for the winter the winter ly and the man who is willing to handle a pick and shovel will
 find employment wage it is true was not high probably averaging about 20 to 30 a month in some cases
 a good living is made by the successful traplower i have heard of some men who went out to per
 this is a limited field however and to make farm and are working for the winter for their an actual
 living a man needs to know the counboard a great many of these harvesters had try well and be a
 good woodsman he should unsaved harvest and threshing wages it is no un derstand the habits of the animals whose
 pelts he common thing in this country for harvesters and is after some men spend a whole lifetime in the
 threshers to have enough saved from their sea woods acquiring such knowledge however many of the farmers and more of
 up bundles that this summer at least weighed from the men working on the farms do make consid 20 to
 40 lbs each a man s job indeed and erable on the side by trapping or killing beavers deserving of
 a man s pay or at threshing time lynx coyotes muskrats and other animals we working in all kinds of
 weather fair or rough had a man who worked on our grain ranch who tossing those same bundles into stook
 wagons made 250 in a single season from muskrat and unloading maybe in wind and biting cold with coyote hides

 labour of each horse a bed but more often than not upon straw upon good riders are always in demand
 on a cattle the ground ranch it is a favourite employment with younger small wonder that these men demanded the
 men some outfits employ only the experienced highest wages possible for their sacrifice and riders but others prefer men who
 are new at the labour but in asking for more than the farmer game but are willing to learn the
 ropes was himself earning showed poor judgement in the experienced rider is often spoiled for other considering the work of
 the harvester we must at work on a ranch they balk at any job not direct the same time look
 at the average farmer who ly connected with the horse or cattle such as employed the harvester was he not
 working hard branding dehorning vaccinating and of course yes harder than any man in his employ i riding and rounding
 up and in the case of horses know a few outfits where the farmer was not cutting out breaking etc
 most of the ranchers workingshouldertoshoulderwiththeharvestand prefer men who besides riding will give a hand at threshing hands and when the
 day s work was fencing and also working in the field at haying done in the field unlike the man
 he employed the time farmer still worked and on nor could he be sure of the daily wage upon which
 at least the physical labour in this country carries with it a harvester could count certain dignity a man does
 not lose caste by we suffer abroad from a erroneous conception working with his hands some of our best fami
