 march of 1919 at a western labour conference in calgary a new union was organized for canadian workers though the
 idea for the union originated with the trade unions of great britain the new union itself was to be all
 canadian and for canadian workers only the aim of this one big union was to unite all workers both white
 collar and manual under one leadership it was to work in the interests of labour and was to be totally
 disaffiliated from international unions at first the one big union s success sullivan with suspicion and labelled him as was
 striking it appealed to the majority of a dangerous revolutionary they refused to workers strong union detachments broke have anything

 u it was here that the ex servicemen attacked but were stood off by the strikers nick gill s house
 is among those in this group the valley separated by brush sometimes doubt the cries of pain accompanied by a
 bit of a garden maybe a fence here and loud swearing meant that many of the misthere in each of
 them lived at least two or sues found their targets unable to cope three people and sometimes as many as
 with the attack the ex servicemen turned could put their bed rolls on the floor about and started running back
 to their cars immediately the strikers taking ad with mr and mrs gill lived an elderly vantage of the retreat

 milky whitenes of early dawn except for the singing the chase was finally abandoned when of the birds the valley
 was sleeping peace the ex servicemen scattered in all directions fully the old man sighed at this hour it on
 top of the hills as the strikers began was hard to believe the harshness of pre to make their way
 back to the valley they ceding days as he stood contemplating the heard rifle shots reverberating through the austere beauty
 of hill and valley his ears valley realizing that all was not well they caught the laboured chugging of approach
 paused on the edge of the hills overlooking ing vehicles the town of drumheller it was then they saw that
 reinforcements had arrived for the he peered into the valley waiting within ex servicemen viore cars and men had minutes
 the cars stopped and he heard a d the valley rang with their shoutcome an commotion as of people thrashing
 through ing they recognized numbers of their own the brush acompanied by loud whoops and men running for the safety
 of the hills cries of outrage he did not need to be told turning on their heels they headed the
 what was happening but hurried back to exodus the shack to warn his nephew wake up wake up he called
 iron i the a number of strikers were captured that doorway his voice rising with the sense of morning but
 the majority gained the hills approaching danger they re coming our here they sought vantage points for obserway hurry vation
 and hiding places in the deep gullies and crevices scattered over a large territory gill was up and dressed in
 no time it was apparent that the special meeting stepping outside he heard heavy thrashing scheduled in the hall for
 that day would through the thick growth of chokecherries not take place however many of them and saskatoons that grew
 along the valley hoped that a meeting could be organized presently he saw men running and recog in the hills
 then as several hours went by nized his neighbours close behind then i it was apparent that there would be
 no aswere their pursuers rending the morning air sembly in the hills after all sullivan was with their cries they
 were heading in the nowhere to be seen sometime during the general direction of gill s shack melee he had

 not in good health he enjoyed visiting with his clergy and was aniazed at the changes which had taken place
 on the prairies since the arrival of the police while resting at fort macleod bishop grandin wrote a letter to
 a friend in st boniface man likely bishop alexandre tache in which he told of his latest experiences dated july
 6 th 1876 it was passed on to the french language st boniface newspaper le metis where it was published

 taken in the 1870 s 8 you might have heard that the condition thus thanks to the sympathy and every
 of my health obliged me to cancel my trip body s charity our fathers are better fed to the west
 just at the time when i was to than those in any other mission but i am undertake it i
 had to delay this voyage to doubtful of my own impressions in this the fall and decided to spend the
 summer regard knowing full well that my poor resting and taking care of myself that is missionaries oftentimes pass on
 to me the what i did until the middle of june small gifts they receive from outside the missionaries of
 our lady of peace do the then i learned that fathers constantine same for n ic in this respect i
 feel sure scollen and leon doucet had not re nevertheless that they are better off than ceived my letters and
 were looking forward others which they really need considering to my arrival being anxious on my behalf the strain they
 have to endure besides their thus i decided to leave by the way i felt frequent long and fatiguing trips
 they are comparatively very well and what is more performing all the other chores by them i was given a
 good opportunity to make the selves they have only one servant a trip consequently i left on the 13 th
 of young indian whom they have brought up june accompanied by a very capable man and who does not seem
 to understand his who took care of my three horses i drove obligations toward them consequently my wagon myself father
 scollen feels tired he would never manage to perform his chores if he had to on the 15 th captain
 dennis cecil rely on the food most of the northern mis denny two policemen and a prisoner left sionaries have
 to eat fort saskatchewan in order to join us next day to take us to bow river we proceeded previously
 we never used to speak about swiftly and set up camp on the 17 th at the wagons colonels or
 captains about the opposite bank of the red deer river at police and a host of things which at the
 four o clock in the afternoon of the 20 th present time have become familiar here we i reached our
 mission our lady of peace had never before seen arriving here trains at the junction of the elbow and bow
 of large wagons pulled by eight or ten mules rivers there fortunately is a police post or by only sixteen
 oxen there is booty at the confuence of tail creek and red in these big wagons and good little foods
 deer river where we got a boat and man an old metis told us there is extraordinaged to cross comfortably
 in one hour s ary activity here enormous amounts of diftime which previously used to require much ferent kinds of
 merchandise are arriving and effort and was quite dangerous i do not understand how the traders manage to cover their
 expenses and make a i am full of praise for my fellow tray profit ellers it was as if they
 all had been my own servants whenever something went wrong i stayed only five days at bow river with my
 wagon or my team the captain was there are no woods on the immense prairthe first to my rescue and
 it is due to his ies between red deer river and bow river charity and his attendance that i managed
 post but both rivers are abundantly bordto travel fast and without fatigue ered with trees and their number increases at
 the approach to the source it appears i found our fathers very poorly lodged that a person is allowed to
 take from here which by the way is always the case with as much timber as one needs for construestarting
 missions their house and their tion and heating on every bank of these chapel resemble those i inhabited at provi
 rivers there are magnificent lowlands prodence but they are not surrounded only by vided with clear sources supplying excellent blackfeet
 besides the government s fort water winter and summer the soil looked calgary there is a good number of white
 rich and fertile but the grasshoppers destroy people living here although they are not everything growing on this soil beginning
 of our faith but almost all of them seen i to at the red deer river down to this place
 understand the missionary s devotion and and even as far as benton there reigns real quite a few like to
 extend their help to him devastation i think that this fact constitutes 9 bishop grandin spent several days at our
 lady of peace mission near fort calgary this sketch of the crude structure was made in 1875 by mounted police
 surgeon h b nevilt the only obstacle to the colonization of this erend scollen to fort macleod and we arcountry
 with exception of the buildings rived there on the 29 th at noon all the belonging to the hudson s
 bay company way we had to cross a real desert but we all the construction at bow river the fort
 also crossed three nice little rivers in the the mission and all the other buildings are vicinity of bow river
 namely fish river only temporary shelters for the time being the pine and the sheep all of them nicely they
 are poor huts without floors or ceilings bordered with trees and watering as much it is fortunately not as cold
 here as in our as i could see excellent land which was un north or else everybody would be frozen
 fortunately infested by grasshoppers there is also the highwood river likewise sur i spent one sunday officiating as pontifi rounded
 by woods but after having passed cally as possible in the poor hut used as a the latter which looked
 to me like a real chapel the adjacent buildings shelter a torrent we did not meet any more woods population
 of around fifty persons only on the 27 th we set up camp at a small river while all the
 natives as well as the metis called the mosquito near the porcupine stay on the prairie mass was sung in
 a hills next day we discovered that the truly solemn way by canadians and irish water we had kept for
 washing was covered men before the mass i experienced the with ice and that the tender leaves of the consolation
 of receiving into the catholic small bushes had turned black church a policeman who had been expecting to see me
 on this purpose for a long fort macleod is located on the oldman time river the latter is divided and
 sub divided into several branches the fort and all the next day the 26 th i went with the rev
 buildings belonging to the businessmen and 10 other inhabitants have been erected on a about the construction at fort macleod
 large island i was surprised to find quite the all of the buildings are temporary the ones fort and at
 least 200 private inhabitants on belonging to the fort as well as those inthe island i really do not know
 what they habited by civilians there are no poorer are doing there agriculture would probably buildings to be found in
 the north all of be less likely to succeed here than in other them are built with inferior wood frequentdistricts
 everything looks as though it is ly with upright poles put close together and burned by the heat and devoured
 by the tied in the same way as they do with fences grasshoppers and still everybody seems the roofs are
 almost flat and covered with busy there is more coming and going and sod there seldom is a floor in
 those houses people moving around than in our north and never a ceiling but one must not this small population
 is composed of judge the interior of these huts from their peoples from every nation there are some exterior the
 inside walls and the ceilings of our own metis mgr herbomez s christ are covered with different kinds of cloth
 and ians and particularly americans it appears sometimes even the floor is covered the that there are even italians spaniards
 and dwellings get light from large dormer chinese these men are mainly looking for windows and they are heated by
 small money alas and do not bother about hearths burning coal in the same manner their souls we have made
 some house calls they have built shops at least 40 to 50 feet these poor people seem to enjoy a
 clergy long where people can buy everything man s visit and treat him with respect and the soil is i
 believe excellent and sevgenerosity whatever their personal faith eral tests have proved it to be productive whenever father scollen has
 visited but unfortunately the grasshoppers are dehere he has been received at the fort like vouring everything even before it
 is ripe i one who has come home and police to met an irishman a few miles from here who
 gether with civilians join together in order has undertaken to breed a large number of to assist him this time
 major irvine as animals which is much easier to do in these signed to each of us his own room
 this parts as there is very little snow in winter kind major the captains and other officers i have been
 told thus cows can spend the i may say are to the utmost obliging winter outdoors and are fat in
 the spring that is what the major intends to do here i find the mounted police delightful he is planning
 to breed at bow fort as well thanks to them troubles caused by whiskey as at this fort enough horses
 and horned traffic have ceased the indians have be cattle to enable him to provide the police conic more reasonable
 they do not kill one with saddle horses and meat in my opinion another any more and they respect even
 this is for the time being the best solution their brethren from other tribes at the pres imaginable ent time
 travellers may cross our plains without fear they do not have to guard their people say that at the mountain
 slopes horses and be alarmed about their scalps there are magnificent places with lakes pro i hope the police stationed
 in my diocese viding fish excellent soil and every kind keep their good spirit and extend their in of trees
 etc fluence to areas where they have not yet we departed on monday the 3 rd of july penetrated they
 truly have given society father scohlen and myself to have a look and the country a fine service at all
 this unfortunately i fell sick the day i don t care if everybody else recognizes before and as i felt
 worse next day we were their merit or not as far as i am concerned obliged to stop at a
 trader s 25 miles from i am pleased with them and i like to say here my health did not
 improve after a so i am convinced that all my missionaries day s rest and i did not dare to
 travel any who have had an opportunity of appreciating farther thus we went directly back i even their service share
 my opinion had to decline the offer made by an irishman who wanted to take us with his wagon i
 will not omit telling you a few words to several posts in the neighbourhood 11 the sharples by alice sharples
 baldwin my mother remembered vividly a cold and windy night in february 1878 when my uncle charlie sharples came to
 say good bye because he was leaving quebec for the west she remembered the gaslight shining on his fair curly
 head he was a tall dashing figure in evening clothes with open coon coat and white scarf as he stood
 in the doorway mother crouched shyly behind the maid for she was only a little girl at the time it
 was all so romantic rumour had it that uncle charlie was going west because he was in love with a
 married woman li i those days a gentleman even a very young gentleman was in honour bound to go somewhere
 else under the circumstances and that somewhere else was frequently the west but if uncle charlie s first motivation where
 the timber booms lined both shores was star crossed love his second was cer of the st lawrence river basin
 tainly horses in a lagging third place may have been the business conditions of the charles sharples senior died in
 1872 time just one year before the market crash steam and iron ships were driving out the sailing the sharples
 family had become estab vessels and the demand for timber was lished in quebec in 1818 after napoleon s sharply

 request of the admiralty to secure faced with diminishing returns on investti ic timber necessary for the walls and masts

 feed it made we bayed until after frost but the first cut was far superior to the latter even so
 that was better than a snow bank for what does not fatten fills the starting date depended on the sloughs
 drying up after the winter snow and june rains my father had a haying lease in the fire place could
 be made by digging a rough country north of pine lake nothing trench in the ground a foot wide and
 deep but hills and sloughs which before the wet enough for a fire a piece of old sheet iron years
 at the turn of the century when they was placed over it leaving it open at each filled with water
 were our only source of end one for smoke and the other for stokwinter feed unlike the south country ours

 was left in swath out feed during a long severe winter with until almost cured then raked into windthe consequent

 labour hand dump rake and one of the new selfcosts we saved cattle over the years they dumping ones seemed
 to have had the best of it slough hay could not be stacked with a the number of cattle we
 could run was buck pole and we did not have sweep rakes as far as i know they were not

 after thirteen years left his own wagon the rack generally was eight feet little place between the bow and elbow
 wide or slightly over and sixteen feet long rivers south of cochrane to move to the very few boards were
 used in its construction the usual material being spruce and parkland country in 1895 poplar of various sizes with willow
 or saska we had a camp on the hay lease for the toon for the basket sides and ends when
 men my father would go home once or the rack was well loaded the hay was haultwice during the week
 with a team and ed to the stack yard and unloaded this buckboard to replenish supplies the camp was even
 harder work than the loading a was primitive even for those days a tent hot hard job a two gallon
 earthenware with low walls the ridge pole supported at jug of water with rolled oats added was each end on

 men a dollar and cups and cheap table utensils bed rolls and an open fire for cooking where he could
 not pitch a well tramped load off one got full benefit of smoke and ash with the hay rack onto
 the stack in eight minutes the grub the bet was accepted and my uncle sought a shady spot in which

 was not until the dry thirties that many of the stacks had to be fire guarded and some sloughs again
 dried up times fenced a fire guard was made by ploughing a furrow round the stacks about soon after the
 turn of the century the thirty feet from them and another furrow high speed mower was invented and it some
 thirty feet beyond that and on a calm could cut the rough fescue grass or as we day the grass
 between the furrows would be called it upland it grew so thick that burnt off this was by no means
 a guar the divider board of the mower frequently antee against loss by fire but it did give could not

 to have jelly with them slings in the rack and a jim pole to pick them up with the hay
 and swing it over to the wet years effectively put an end to the stack another was to use harpoon
 forks laying sloughs indeed so suddenly did the which were all right in timothy or slough torrents of rain con

 most famous war chief and statesman is misconception that crowfoot was mere unrivalled in his book crow foot putty in
 the hands of the white man rather crowfoot is depicted as a far sighted man there is an interesting side
 story to this who took whatever route he thought that book it was written over ten years ago was most
 beneficial to his people even at however no publisher in canada wanted to that crowfoot is not pictured as an
