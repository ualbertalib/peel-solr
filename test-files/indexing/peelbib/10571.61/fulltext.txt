 jp pl message from the colonel in chief 1998 was another exciting year when my patricias continued to perform well 
 on exercises professional courses overseas on individual un missions and on normal duties in garrison commencing the this very active 
 year was the deployment of all three battalions to quebec to assist fellow canadians in the aftermath of the most 
 damaging ice storms to hit central canada although i did not visit my soldiers in canada i was very pleased 
 to have members of the regiment visit my country in may queen elizabeth and her british subjects warmly received soldiers 
 of the regiment when they performed 0:per 0:formed the duties of mounting the guard at buckingham palace not only was 
 great honour bestowed upon our regiment but also our soldiers performed 0:per 0:formed their duties in an admirable fashion all 
 the spectators were most impressed with the professionalism demonstrated by the ppcli guard in november some soldiers participated in the 
 dva sponsored remembrance celebrations at some of the world war 1 battlefields in france and flanders honouring those patricia s 
 who gave their lives in battle sergeant spall ppcli vc winner was recognized in england on the brentford war memorial 
 in a ceremony attended by both the regimental major and myself although unable to attend i received wonderful reports on 
 the excellent parades and ceremonies surrounding the changes of command of second and third battalion the third battalion dedicated the 
 new brigadier jimmy de lalanne building and shortly there after provided much needed support to civil authorities in fighting forest 
 fires in central british columbia as we approach the 85th anniversary of our regiment and my 25th anniversary as your 
 colonel in chief i do so look forward to my visit to canada to see my patricias both serving and 
 retired the 85th anniversary celebrations from 1 4 july 1999 will be a historical focal point to celebrate the fine 
 achievements of our regiment the motto of our 85th anniversary is very appropriate the proud heritage continues

 cd message from the colonel of the regiment 1998 started off with the operational deployment of all three patricia battalions 
 to western quebec their mission to provide assistance to a population overwhelmed by the impact of a significant natural disaster 
 as they had during the red river flood 10 months earlier the soldiers won the hearts of the local population 
 with their cheerful dedication while working very long hours in uncomfortable and often dangerous conditions 0:con 0:ditions well done patricias 
 the regiment was greatly honoured when requested to mount the guard at buckingham palace st james palace and the tower 
 of london during april and may the faultless performance of the queen s guard drawn mainly from the third battalion 
 drew very favourable comment from many veterans of the household brigade the third battalion s new accommodation in edmonton garrison 
 was dedicated in memory of brigadier jimmy de lalanne in a ceremony held 17 june de lalanne distinguished 0:dis 0:tinguished 
 himself as a ppcli nco in the first world war and as assistant adjutant general during world war two he 
 was truly a great canadian with broad interests and influence but remained dedicated to our regiment and to his comrades 
 in the regimental association two other memorials were erected this year to record significant 0:signif 0:icant aspects of our history 
 on 24 april a monument was unveiled on radar hill in pacific rim national park commemorating the stand of 2 
 ppcli at kapyong 47 years earlier the second monument was unveiled on 10 july to record the regiment s historical 
 0:his 0:torical connection to fort osborne barracks in winnipeg now the asper community college the 85th anniversary of the regiment 
 will also see lady patricia celebrate her 25th year as the colonel in chief the major celebration will take place 
 in edmonton 2 4 july but lady patricia has agreed to visit a number of other locations across canada so 
 that she may see as many patricias as possible i urge you all to proudly celebrate both these important anniversaries 
 with the passing of major general c b ware on 22 january 1999 the regimental family lost not only a 
 much respected and beloved senior member but a significant link to our past cammie joined the ppcli in 1935 commanded 
 it gallantly during the italian campaign knew very well the founder and the first colonel in chief was the colonel 
 of the regiment for eighteen years and maintained a firm devotion to his regiment for over 63 years he has 
 left us the finest example one could ever imagine of service over self and it is now up to us 
 to keep his lesson alive

 passed since canadian soldiers last marched through the gates of buckingham palace on 28 april 1998 nerves were on edge 
 for all the members of the guard composed of soldiers from the third battalion with a composite corps of drums 
 from all three battalions as they marched into the forecourt with lady patricia the canadian high commissioner general de chastelain 
 and a crowd of thousands watching the pressure was on to perform two weeks of drill under the watchful eye 
 of three welsh guard drill instructors proved its worth the soldiers once they remembered to breath and relax a bit 
 performed impeccably having mounted the guard they then endured long hours on sentry in front of buckingham palace st james 
 palace and in the tower of london by the end of our tour compliments were plentiful including several from the 
 royal family about the drill deportment and professionalism 0:professional 0:ism of our soldiers without a doubt the spectators who were 
 fortunate 0:fortu 0:nate enough to witness the patricia s changing the guard with a guards unit will remember it for 
 some time to come 
 the patrician 1998 17 queen s inspection buckingham palace each day that the regiment mounted the guard at buckingham palace 
 they also provided a guard at the tower of london and at the residence of prince charles and the queen 
 mother st james palace at the tower of london the soldiers had the real task of guarding the crown jewels 
 as well as the nightly ceremonial parade known as the ceremony of the keys guarding the tower of london proved 
 slightly more hazardous than buckingham palace as pte webber will attest the paving stones proved more slippery than the gravel 
 of buckingham palace to cleated boots and without the benefit 0:bene 0:fit of practice on that kind of surface he 
 found himself staring at the sky after an unsuccessful halt needless to say the tower guard marched with great caution 
 after that experience this is not to say that the soldiers at buckingham palace and st james were free from 
 harm it was not always easy keeping a straight face when the crowd is yelling out hooray canada or the 
 local nuisance learns your name from the guards and calls it out as you march by the composite corps of 
 drums had their work cut out for them as they not only led the way on every mounting and dismounting 
 of the guard but also had numerous other events and shows to play it was encouraging to learn after we 
 experienced several problems with the slow pace of the various guards bands who marched us in 
 the patrician 1998 18 major lan hunt escorting her majesty the queen during the inspection of the guard that the 
 guards battalions were equally irritated by the light infantry pace set by drum major williston as he led them from 
 the palace it was truly a proud moment and put a bounce in the patricias step as they marched from 
 st james palace to buckingham palace on their first dismount with the corps of drums pounding out a beat they 
 could march to before arriving in england one of the big concerns was training the ppcli drivers to drive the 
 perilous streets of downtown london however the worries were quickly erased when cpl devenney and cpl phillips came into the 
 picture they proved to be expert drivers in no time at all with a mere five accidents in the first 
 week of course none of these were their fault so they said as the british were consistently 0:con 0:sistently driving 
 on the wrong side of the street and only the insane would use a round about throughout their stay the 
 patricia guard were quartered at raf station uxbridge on the western outskirts of london here they experienced british cuisine deep 
 fried or boiled one laundry machine for every 50 soldiers and the perils of a fifty minute bus ride for 
 every mounting joking aside it was a very pleasant location away from the noise of downtown london 
 the patrician 1998 19 ppcli touring london and if you look to your right you will see buckingham palace the 
 contingent also took part in two guards of honour one for her majesty the queen at buckingham palace to commemorate 
 the re opening of canada house the second for prime minister chretien at lincoln s inn field for the unveiling 
 of a canadian rcaf war monument for the soldiers senior ncos and officers who were part of the guard it 
 was an experience filled with pride reward and some good times long hours of drill and standing sentry were usually 
 rewarded with a day or two off to visit the various sites in and around london and sample some of 
 the local spirits the guard also formed a rugby team which was regrettably thrashed by the raf in their only 
 game during the week of leave at the end of the tour the members of the guard from the 3 
 ppcli parachute company put up their maroon berets and jumped with 10th parachute battalion to earn their british wings in 
 all it was a very worthwhile event for both canada and the members who served one which will be remembered 
 with pride as a unique event in their lives

 0:gent was a 50 man guard composed of members from each of the regular force infantry regiments 2ppcli was fortunate 
 enough to receive the tasking and the honour of representing the regiment preparations began in september with the contingent being 
 selected amid the cries from those not selected and accusations of swarming etc the first task was to bring everyone 
 up to speed on drill and specifically the conduct of funeral and firing parties sgt paul muise was given this 
 responsibility which he executed with a vengeance soon resting on arms reversed became second nature and one member of the 
 guard even perfected the resting on your facereversed 0:face 0:reversed technique on 1 november the patricia s departed winnipeg for 
 ottawa and linked up with the remainder of the infantry contingent after two days of drill the patricia s were 
 selected for all firing parties and special duties they departed ottawa as the advance party on 3 november and headed 
 surprisingly to london the plan was to pick up buses from a uk tour company and after a quick channel 
 crossing to calais head to their hotel in lille france sadly the gods of swarming 0:swar 0:ming were uncooperative and 
 a sudden strike by the ferry workers in calais left them stranded in dover with nothing to do but examine 
 the white cliffs and drink expensive beer they eventually made it to france via belgium and were ready to commence 
 their task the first ceremony was on historic vimy ridge the french government honoured our world war one veterans with 
 france s legion of honour the ceremony with a canadian british and french contingent was very impressive using the vimy 
 memorial as the background there was a surprisingly large crowd in attendance with people from the local communities and several 
 busloads of school children from the uk following the parade the contingent was given a tour of the vimy

 students employed on a three month term contract 0:con 0:tract as site tour guides the students said how proud they 
 were of their army during the ceremony and that the canadians looked better than the other armies present it is 
 suspected however that this compliment was directed specifically 0:specif 0:ically at privates torrance and alcock during the next few days 
 the contingent 0:contin 0:gent participated in several smaller ceremonies 0:cere 0:monies at various battlefield memorials each stop on the journey 
 became an education on the sacrifice of our forefathers 0:forefa 0:thers one that stuck out for all was the ceremony 
 at beaumont hamel on the first day battle of the somme 1 july 1916 the royal newfoundland regiment were slaughtered 
 in an ill fated assault the band accompanying the pilgrimage was from the r nfld r in a truly moving 
 moment the band played with tears in their eyes as the special patricia bearer party marched on the royal newfoundland

 the war at le quesnel near amiens tour narrated by some historians this proved quite entertaining if not a little 
 confusing as each one of the experts seemed to have a different orientation on the subject in fact some almost 
 started to believe that the germans launched the yon schliefen plan across the channel from somewhere in dorset when in 
 ypres the contingent 2 i c set captain fawcett a quest to see the ppcli monument at frezenberg finding this 
 key point in regimental history was more difficult 0:dif 0:ficult than some might imagine armed with directions from several experts 
 the party set off to find the monument in a belgian farm field it soon became apparent that the directions 
 were incorrect and frustration 0:frus 0:tration overcame the contingent and they gave up for the promise of beer in ypres 
 always interested to see more captain fawcett set out with members of the rcr to see the monument at hill 
 62 here he encountered a sergeant from a green jacket battalion who gave him the precise directions to frezenberg and 
 so accompanied by 10 members of the other english speaking regiment he found the ppcli memorial after singing the regimental 
 march past which all members 0:mem 0:bers of the rcr had by now memorized he gathered some ceremonial 0:cere 0:monial 
 earth for wo dumas and rejoined the group in ypres the highlight of the trip was the ceremony performed at 
 the crest 
 the patrician 1998 25 ppcli firing party at crest cemetery france cemetery near the french town of cambrai after painstaking 
 work by the regimental adjutant captain steve newman the identity of one of the regiment s fallen comrades was determined 
 and the patricia s had the opportunity to dedicate the new headstone originally the ceremony for sergeant smokie thompson was 
 planned by dva to be a quick stop on the pilgrimage itinerary however it was a patricia show and the 
 ppcli contingent set out to pay their appropriate respect they had trained hard for this moment and more importantly it 
 was for one of our patricia s who had lain for eighty years in the grave of an unknown soldier 
 the first change to the master plan came when all members of the r nfld r band insisted on accompanying 
 the ppcli in paying their respects and attended the ceremony also there were sergeant thompson s relatives les and darlene 
 thompson along with the minister of veterans affairs the honourable fred mifflin and mrs mifflin the ceremony was brief with 
 volleys fired and a regimental camp flag was struck and presented to les thompson before lowering 0:low 0:ering the flag 
 the r nfld r band played the ppcli march past with the patricia s singing the medley and as they 
 sang the patricia s noticed that all the members of the rcr and r22er had formed up around them and 
 were saluting our regiment and our fallen comrade there was not a dry eye anywhere with their duty complete they 
 returned to canada with a better understanding of where the regiment came from and what it really is to be

 being from the united kingdom and the remainder from the dominions and colonies from time to time soldier s remains 
 are recovered from the battlefields and some are identified but most have disappeared for 
 the patrician 1998 29 ever less than half of the missing are buried as unidentified in cemeteries the unknown sergeant 
 was one of these and his name was carved somewhere on the vimy ridge memorial the canadian corps was in 
 full stride in the second half of 1918 along with the australian corps and several british divisions they spearheaded the 
 allied effort to victory in the mad dash known as the last one hundred days it began with inflicting the 
 black day in the history of the german army at amiens 8 august 1918 and ended with the capture of 
 mons 11 november 1918 between the two points lay heavy fighting and casualties on 28 september 1918 the unknown sergeant 
 and the princess patricia s canadian light infantry ppcli crossed the canal dv nord near bourlon wood and then swept 
 across the open fields towards cambrai as members of the 7th brigade 3rd canadian division they were asked to crack 
 the marcoing line the last of the major german prepared defence lines west of cambrai the royal canadian regiment rcr 
 led the brigade attack with the patricia s in support even before the battle could be joined the patricia s 
 lost their commanding officer lieutenant colonel charlie stewart dso he and several men were killed by shell fire as they 
 moved across the open fields towards raillencourt the rcr enjoyed initial 0:ini 0:tial success before being held up by flanking 
 fire from st olle and the enemy support line in sailly the patricia s deployed and helped force the support 
 0:sup 0:port line into canadian hands by mid afternoon at 7p m the patricia s and the edmonton regiment 49th 
 bn attacked towards the fortified village of tilloy the assault was caught up in heavy wire obstacles overgrown and not 
 obvious from aerial photos furthermore the enemy covered the obstacles with machine gun fire which inflicted heavy casualties on the 
 assaulting force the next day three officers and forty men were discovered killed in a small area where they had 
 failed to claw their way through the wire during three days of heavy fighting between 28 30 september 1918 the 
 princess patricia s canadian light infantry suffered 375 killed wounded and missing among them was the unknown sergeant 
 the patrician 1998 30 for eighty years the grave remained unnamed the occasional visitor would stop by and visit those 
 with names or possibly wonder about the five men who were unidentified in the cemetery the peaceful 0:peace 0:ful setting

 their only constant 0:con 0:stant and faithful companions are the gardeners of the commonwealth war graves commission who spend so 
 much loving attention and care on the war graves and grounds of cemeteries around the world a new series of 
 books dealing with the patricia s in the great war has been researched and the first with the patricia s 
 in flanders 1914 1918 then and now will be published in 1999 a similar book will be done for france 
 as well the basis of the series is an in depth view of the regiment during the fighting and a 
 look at the battleground 0:battle 0:ground today each cemetery and memorial to the missing has the full service record for 
 each patricia buried or commemorated there it was in the course of this research that the identity of the unknown 
 sergeant was discovered the regiment lost six sergeants on 28 september 1918 all had known graves except for one he 
 was sergeant george ross thompson thompson according to his attestation papers was born in kenora ontario 5 april 1888 when

 were mobilizing as well there were a few taken despite the lack of service 0:serv 0:ice and thompson was one

 main line the determined men bluffed the day and night operators of the station into letting them wait for the 
 train despite having no paperwork or authorization from cpr to join the train or use the rail coaches when the 
 train arrived thompson was quick to connect the two extra cars before it could leave although the conductor refused to 
 co operate at first coercion and bluff got them to the next rail divisional point they were told that they 
 must produce a copy of their authorization upon arrival fortunately the conductor changed and once again through bluff and coercion 
 they reached winnipeg hamilton gault the founder of the regiment who had been receiving telegrams about this strange group attached

 when we got our first whiff of the of the place a strong smell of sewage struck our nostrils welcome

 of the city of seoul i remembered 0:remem 0:bered the day i left a fine sunny day the airport busy 
 with the take offs of fb6 sabres roaring off the runway in pairs circling overhead and then heading north to 
 the yalu as fighter cover for the 829 s that were bombing north korea the airport still bore the scars 
 of earlier bombings by the americans when the airport was held by the north koreans wrecked hangars burned out planes 
 bulldozed into heaps we landed and the scene was much like narita in japan busy terminal 0:termi 0:nal buildings 747

 and immigration collecting another stamp in our passports embussed and headed for the city you caught a glimpse of this 
 city of 11 million people as we drew closer high rise apartment blocks filled the horizon as we sped along 
 the six lane freeway to the city sunday 11 october we travelled early in the day to kapyong the road 
 trip was through the now heavily forested hilly country that was completely foreign to my eyes gone were the barren 
 hills that we knew stripped of their stunted growth by wood hungry peasants for their wood fires now the hills 
 were covered in a luxurious growth of coniferous and deciduous trees and as our coach sped along the smooth highway 
 i thought back to the times that i had probably travelled 0:trav 0:elled that same road narrow gravelled and pot 
 holed then in my job as liaison officer in the spring of 51 we stopped at a roadside rest 
 the patrician 1998 48 area where our piper entertained the local travellers much to their delight our buses carried a 
 large canadian flag on the front and banners on the sides announcing our status as korean war veterans and people 
 would wave and old soldiers salute as we passed we formed up on the main street of naechon and marched 
 to the small memorial park where we met with a large group of korean veterans 0:vet 0:erans lining the walk 
 to the impressive memorial was an armed honour guard from the first rok division smartly turned out in camouflage 0:cam

 beautiful park like setting we would repeat our wreath laying and i would have the opportunity to read the united 
 states presidential unit citation kindly 0:kind 0:ly provided me by wo boulter of 2ppcli in a separate ceremony at the 
 adjacent ppcli memorial i laid a wreath assisted by lalonde and desjarlais we were joined by all former or serving 
 members of the regiment the kapyong feature hill 677 was not recognizable to me for it is now covered with 
 trees it stood of to the west of our position 0:posi 0:tion its history now cloaked in the silence of 
 the forest after a fine picnic lunch we boarded our buses for the trip back to seoul arriving at the 
 un cemetery at pusan we were again honoured with a rok guard of honour lining the approach to this most 
 magnificent 0:mag 0:nificent cemetery for myself and others this would prove to be the most emotional event of our pilgrimage 
 for here lay the greatest number of our canadian dead 378 small canadian flags marking each grave canada s ambassador 
 to south korea arthur parent and veterans affairs minister fred miflin laid wreaths at the memorial and the minister delivered 
 a moving address following which we laid our wreaths the last ceremony of our pilgrimage was at the memorial to 
 the missing where the names of sixteen canadians are inscribed including four patricias our youth group sang amazing grace accompanied 
 by the piper and bugler we then set out to find the graves of soldiers we had known to pay 
 in our own private way our respects for our fallen comrades it was a day to remember on our last 
 evening in korea a dinner was held at which members expressed their appreciation to the minister and veterans affairs staff

 those who do not know fort irwin is a large training area in the mojave desert in which the terrain 
 is comprised mostly of sandy flats and rocky hills with a number 0:num 0:ber of wadis running from the high 
 ground down into the plains conducting tasks composed of everything from platoon defensives to a company level raid alpha company 
 not only did the battalion but also the canadian army proud in its aggressive fighting style while the use of 
 the miles gear was instructive it did prove to be rather demoralizing when faced with the superior technology of the 
 us arsenal however the fighting spirit of alpha company would 
 the patrician 1998 73 prevail in honour of one particular battle in which members of the company scaled a ridge 
 with a dismounted tow system to secure a key area and prevent the blue force penetration alpha company received the 
 first class hamby award named after u s colonel hamby a former member of opfor who died in a vehicle 
 accident the award is given to individuals and units for meritorious combat service 0:ser 0:vice with opfor as well the

 unit aggregate award which symbolizes dominance in 1 cmbg team sports as the week commenced all teams were in the 
 running for their respective titles while the competition was very intense and hard fought three of the four teams made 
 it to the semi finals however after very close matches all were to be defeated the final standings for the 
 second battalion was hockey fourth place floor hockey third place broomball fourth place and volleyball not performing to their usual 
 high standard finished last when the results had been tabulated 0:tabu 0:lated the battalion had narrowly lost the major unit

 100 the patrician 1998 western area training centre camp wainwright alberta 1998 the year in review 1998 was another busy 
 year for all patricias at watc whether permanent staff or augmentees from the battalions watc is now over a year 
 old and most of the growing pains those that one can expect with the formation of any new organization have 
 been resolved one thing that has remained constant over the past year has been the feverish pace of construction and 
 infrastructure upgrade it seems that daily old buildings are being torn down and new ones built in their place one 
 of the good things about being a patricia in wainwright is the fact that the battalions regularly conduct exercises in 
 the training area and this affords us the opportunity to meet with old friends and catch up on the latest 
 scuttlebutt from those on regimental tour so when you are in the area whether it s the training area or 
 the local wainwright area don t forget to visit and let us now what s going on yp watc headquarters

 decision came from gagetown just before the christmas leave period and i know it was not the christmas present they 
 were looking for at least they didn t get bored over the holidays on a positive note this course dispels 
 any nasty rumors that wo mansbridge manages to cancel any courses 0:cours 0:es for which he is responsible capt migadel 
 and sgts turner todd palmer sansom and wyszynski will assist wo mansbridge in the professional conduct of the course ironically 
 they were all biting at the bit to get on with business until they found out they re not deploying 
 0:deploy 0:ing to the arctic sorry fellas no caribou and inuit carvings this time jlc and jnco candidates were feverishly 
 pumped through the company 0:com 0:pany during 1998 the instructors all now with a minimum of one year in the 
 company under their belt took the busy pace in stride the overriding question in their minds is not when am 
 i getting out of here but where am i going after this their concern comes from recent transfers of two 
 senior instructors for their dedicated service to leadership training wo semenko and sgt gallant were moved to support positions wo 
 semenko traded places with wo trelnuk as the tqms sgt gallant is now the accns nco hey gents don t 
 forget what you learned in diversity training 1998 definitely had its share of surprises 1999 is sure to be just 
 as plentiful 
 the patrician 1998 103 mcpl joel maclaren acting as an innocent bystander referee during the officer senior nco broom i 
 100 game basic training company basic training company of the western area training centre has managed to settle into some 
 semblance of a routine recently which comes as a welcome break after a hectic training cycle which has kept everyone 
 very busy over the past year the spring saw numerous 0:numer 0:ous graduations of courses that had begun the previous 
 fall and as the regular force courses thinned out we began to receive the influx of reservists for the ncac 
 training cycle following the graduation of more than 600 reserve soldiers from ql 2 and 3 courses this summer 0:sum 
 0:mer the pace of regular force training has again picked up all told we will have graduated eight platoons of 
 trained soldiers for the wo riches showing off his good side to executrek participants 
 the patrician 1998 104 wo yuile sending a recruit over the edge regiment by the end of 1998 all this 
 training is conducted with heavy augmentee support from the regiment and reserve brigades with the posting freeze this past aps 
 the company has seen limited 0:limit 0:ed personnel changes wo yuile moved to 3 ppcli in edmonton where his knowledge 
 of tented camps should be put to good use and newly promoted major mcknight moved out of his position as 
 standards officer and took over the company in june this allowed major brause to move to rhq in edmonton to 
 assume the duties of the regimental major company 2ic captain heth and csm mwo schaffel remained to assist the new 
 oc while wos riches and murphy have continued to train new recruits and assist young platoon 0:pla 0:toon commanders during 
 ql 3 courses sgt jessop survived as course wo during the marathon ql 2 3 course and escaped to a 
 block french course for a break sgt beattie continues in the thankless 0:thank 0:less job of looking after holding platoon 
 and finally sgt s hessel and ruest seem to spend more time training junior leaders in advanced training company so 
 we don t see much of them 
 105 the patrician 1998 we have also kept involved with the community at large by supporting 0:sup 0:porting the alberta 
 rotary club youth leadership conference and the wainwright high school project excel both events were very well received and the 
 organizers were abundant in their praise of the company 0:com 0:pany for our support this summer we also hosted executrek 
 which is an event where various employers are given the opportunity to observe reserve force training this is done in 
 the hopes that these employers will see that benefit of employing reservists and will support 0:sup 0:port them by enacting 
 policies which will allow them the time off to progress in their reserve career without penalty so all in all 
 it has been busy year as every other article in the patrician will no doubt attest but seeing recruits be 
 trained and leave watc wearing the patricia cap badge is a rewarding and worthwhile task sgt jessop taking a breather 
 during fibua 
 the patrician 1998 106 militia training support centre mtsc another year has passed for the mtsc patricia s the beginning 
 of 1998 saw us continuing on with assessment visits assisting the militia units of the army of the west with 
 their defensive skills this kept us busy until may 98 when we began our demanding summer schedule wo les leighton 
 demonstrating excellent combined arms skills assembled and reviewed several armoured ql 3 course packages 0:pack 0:ages and then became the 
 platoon wo for personnel awaiting training pat platoon holding platoon for you dinosaurs wo gord hill became the course wo

 pi ptes krita millman rodrigue mcgraw focussed on becoming infantrymen mountain man competition capt mike blackburn went to watc headquarters 
 to take over the demanding training coordination job which allowed him lots of time to practice kicking in doors for 
 the dwyer hill gang and capt glen zilkalns prepared for the job of head counselor at kamp krusty aka reserve 
 ql 2 tent city needless to say these were all rewarding jobs that allowed for extended opportunities for personal growth 
 and self discovery the mtsc patricias also took the opportunity to recruit a new patricia convincing lt doug clark ex 
 calgary highlanders that the ppcli 
 the patrician 1998 107 was the only way to go unfortunately for us he soon disappeared off to the third 
 battalion following the tribulations of the summer the mtsc patricia s less capt blackburn who obviously was too good at 
 the training coordination job regrouped to prepare for the fall assessment season the teams were kept busy with the switch 
 to offensive operations as each unit needed all available personnel for a fair and accurate assessment wainwright as usual proved 
 to be inhospitable to the visiting units giving them weather problems to contend 0:con 0:tend with as well as the 
 tactical problems and the eastern road trip to visit 38 brigade units was as enjoyable as ever capt zilkalns disappeared 
 0:dis 0:appeared off to cfb gagetown for six weeks for itc ii in october and november and wo leighton vanished 
 to edmonton for foot surgery in december slowing him down somewhat overall it was a typical year for the mtsc

 he was known to even conduct a few issues of an operational matter all those of ops and trg were

 yp quebec area patricia s the year started off with a snap crackle and finally pop as lights all over 
 quebec went out ice storm 98 was upon us with more freezing rain falling in one week than the area 
 normally receives annually the province was crippled when the hydro network supplying 0:sup 0:plying the greater montreal area succumbed under 
 the heavy burden of ice parks forests and countless farms were completely devastated 0:devas 0:tated by the effects of the 
 storm patricias from all over canada answered the call almost immediately 0:immedi 0:ately all three battalions met in st jean 
 and were housed together in the drill hall for many this was an excellent opportunity to meet with old buddies 
 and catch up while waiting for the infinite number of o groups the patricias in the canadian forces leadership and 
 recruit school were employed in a wide varierty of roles during operation recuperation these included assisting the municipal and provincial 
 police forces working at shelters and most importantly act

 clean up started immediately in order to prepare 0:pre 0:pare for the next series of recruit courses scheduled for march 
 the outpouring of thanks from surrounding communities was overwhelming 0:overwhelm 0:ing what was especially memorable was the specific mention of 
 the ppcli in full page announcements in newspapers throughout the region rest assured that brought a smile to the faces 
 of us who actually live here in la belle province in july 98 cflrs sent a team to the nijmegan 
 marches the team represented the base and included members from many different 0:differ 0:ent backgrounds of note however was the 
 fact that the team included 0:includ 0:ed three patricias mcpl mullick wo power team 2 i c and capt sbarra 
 who acted as team captain the three members represented the regiment with distinction and reportedly indoctrinated a whole new generation 
 of young dutch by teaching them the lyrics to the patricia medley cflrs celebrating march 17th

 outstanding 0:out 0:standing soldier when rick dodds decided to leave the cf and try his hand at business we wish 
 him and his family the best of luck the patricias raised the flag on 17 march in recognition of our 
 regimental day a luncheon organized by wo power followed the game of broom i loo and a few post game 
 refreshments were the order of the day participation by other cflrs members was enthusiastic 0:enthu 0:siastic and a great time 
 was had by all with the only casualties of the day being wo power s glasses that took a direct 
 hit from a runaway broom in the heat of battle all in all it was a productive year in true

 99 sounds like fun acer acerpori vp 
 the patrician 1998 133 atlantic branch as our branch only meets once a year it is quite a feat to 
 put everything together for our annual meeting and fall get together the fall 1998 one was once again held in 
 new glasgow nova scotia on 2 4 october organized and hosted by president rick muise and his very capable assistant 
 wife margaret headquarters and activity centre 0:cen 0:tre was at the royal canadian legion new glasgow where a meet and 
 greet was held on friday evening and the agm was held saturday morning following an afternoon of tours including the 
 giant sobeys computer head office and the sobeys art gallery crombie a mess dinner was held in the evening again 
 at the legion who provided 0:pro 0:vided an excellent meal followed by a dance some of our regular old warriors 
 were missing this year due to ill health etc among our most active members missing were norm and sherry richardson 
 norm being in the veterans hospital in halifax where he has been since suffering a stroke in early summer sunday 
 morning seen us all at the cenotaph for a service specially adapted to our regiment by padre foster b jenkins 
 an ex patricia airborne regt following a farewell till we meet again luncheon at the legion it was reluctant goodbyes 
 for the most of us till we meet again in charlottetown pei next fall hosted by error monkley and islanders 
 once a p atr icia always a patricia church parade at new glasgow cenotaph 
 the patrician 1998 134 ottawa branch ottawa branch was honoured by the association by allowing the association annual general meeting 
 to be held in ottawa during august 1998 the activities took place as planned but not without many changes to 
 locations and dates as the branch tried to accommodate 0:accom 0:modate many other schedules we learned that one must plan 
 early and then stick to the original dates we hope that too many individuals 0:individ 0:uals were not inconvenienced by 
 the many changes which were totally beyond our control we certainly thank bill love and his hardworking 0:hard 0:working agm 
 team for their dedication and hard work in putting it all together our members now know how much effort is 
 put in by the visiting members from other branches in preparing submissions as required to travel great distances at their 
 own expense in both time and money ottawa branch members were able to meet many of the out of town 
 friends they had known or served with many years before one of the unresolved problems of the association which is 
 equally 0:equal 0:ly a problem for most branches is the inability of the association and branches to attract former patricia 
 s into becoming participating members considerable time was devoted to discussing this conundrum 0:conun 0:drum why is it that individuals 
 proudly serve for many years as active members of the regiment and then fail to continue this association 0:asso 0:ciation 
 after they have left the regular forces it is clear that some are very busy establishing second careers and devoting 
 much more time to families that service conditions had forced into second place however membership in the association usually entails 
 such a minimal 0:mini 0:mal cost in time and money that it is difficult to see why there is such 
 a failure to join did the comradeship and belonging to the regiment mean so little we think not but are 
 open to all suggestions from whatever source to improve membership one motion that passed at the annual general meeting will 
 let former regular force or militia personnel who have served with or as patricia s have their first year s 
 membership in the association without cost it is interesting to note that many other service oriented organizations such as the 
 korean veterans association to name but one appear to have a better 0:bet 0:ter participation perhaps the ppcli association is 
 too broad and too undemanding of the members we all know that there are many groups within the regiment that 
 are very under represented patricia s should put on their thinking caps and propose a solution 
 the patrician 1998 135 on a very sad note gordon hurlbert ottawa branch s if not the regiment s last 
 surviving world war 1 member passed away on september 26th gordon was in his 100 th year and had been 
 a staunch member of the ottawa branch and before that the ottawa patricia club since the 19205 lois his wife 
 will remain an honorary member of the branch we will remember him ottawa branch is worried over the fate of 
 landsdowne park the site of the patricia cairn marking the location of the founding of the regiment and site of 
 the first parade currently the city of ottawa is proposing to sell much of the park including the stadium to 
 reduce the annual funding coming from the city taxpayers one proposal by developers is retain a modified civic centre outside 
 of which sits the cairn if this proposal is selected an option is to relocate the patricia cairn to a 
 spot adjacent to the aberdeen pavilion a heritage site of patricia significance that is expected to remain the current leases 
 for the civic centre stadium and parts that will be affected by the redevelopment currently run until the year 2001 
 thus urgent action is not necessary another matter that keeps the branch busy is the discovery that a verbal promise 
 had been made to provide permanent floodlighting for the hamilton gault statue which is located opposite the national war memorial 
 the branch has no idea of the capital or ongoing costs of such an endeavour but will obtain quotes for 
 the national executive currently the whole area around the national war memorial is undergoing 0:under 0:going extensive infrastructure renovations they 
 are rebuilding the roads and underground storm and sanitary sewers which will construction 0:con 0:struction turmoil to last for another 
 year hopefully we will be able to incorporate any changes to the founder s statue so that they will take 
 place during the same timeframe currently one can view the founder s statue but it is partly hidden by construction 
 hoarding that is almost all the worthwhile news from ottawa branch at this time our next event is the annual 
 colonel in chief s birthday dinner scheduled for the ndhq warrant officers sergeants mess on the evening of the 17th 
 of march please join us there if you are town best wishes to all patricia s from ottawa branch yp 
 
 the patrician 1998 136 toronto branch greetings from the toronto branch we are still alive and kicking although for the 
 past few years we had been going downhill in the past few months we have gained three new members i

 the patrician 1998 137 manitoba n w ontario branch 1998 began rather quietly for the manitoba and north western ontario 
 branch with our usual monthly meetings in january and february and our annual regimental birthday social on march 15th the 
 latter event did not attract a large crowd but we did enjoy ourselves 0:our 0:selves and will continue to make 
 this an annual event once again second battalion were in the field on kapyong day but their rear party were 
 able to muster up a couple of dozen troops to back up the branch for the annual ceremony at the 
 kapyong monument in front of the officers mess two of our kapyong vets george black and ed higham were at 
 the unveiling of the new kapyong monument at pacific rim national park on vancouver island and some of our members 
 were attending jack sansomes s funeral in selkirk so we were a little thin on the ground bob cumming read 
 the citation and jim wall and nick oshanski placed a wreath at the base of the monument 0:mon 0:ument then 
 we all moved into the wos and sgts mess for the usual critique the weather wasn t that great and 
 a few of our early registrants from the wos and sgts mess had to withdraw because of summer taskings but 
 we still managed to muster 28 players from the branch the wos and sgts mess and the junior ranks club 
 for our season opener golf tournament at windsor park on june sth it was a jackets 0:jack 0:ets on jackets 
 off sort of day but we managed to get through it without 0:with 0:out getting wet many of us had 
 not played the windsor park course before and enjoyed the new experience unfortunately a few of the battalion members had 
 difficulty finding the course and we suspect a couple of those who didn t show up by tee off time 
 are still out there looking for it on july 10th coincidentally the 55th anniversary of the landing in sicily a 
 large gathering of members and friends of the regiment returned to the site of old fort osborne barracks to witness 
 an impressive ceremony featuring a 100 man guard of honour from second battalion accompanied by their colours and drum line 
 drums were piled and following a brief introduction by rod middleton chairman of the regimental heritage committee the fort osborne 
 monument was unveiled by major general retd bill hewson colonel of the regiment and doug bedford national president of the 
 ppcli association and a dedication service was 
 the patrician 1998 138 the sicily veterans l r lloyd kreamer mm robert mcmurdo andrew schaen fred snell dcm norman 
 mccowan charles murray nick nowosad mcl hidlebaugh and sydney mckay conducted by second battalion s chaplain lieutenant navy steve merriman 
 present at the ceremonies were nine veterans of the landing in sicily who had served in fort osborne barracks before 
 proceeding overseas in late 1939 and early 1940 and the widows of three others who had served overseas with the 
 regiment in world war two the 30 plus temperature and murderous humidity they endured at the ceremony must have reminded 
 them of the climate in sicily 55 years earlier now the asper jewish community campus fort osborne barracks was the 
 regiment s home from 1920 until proceeding overseas 0:over 0:seas in ww 11 dedication of the monument was planned as 
 part of the 45th kapyong anniversary activities in june 1996 but construction 0:construc 0:tion of the new campus at the 
 time prevented access to the site it was finally erected on september sth 1997 in a prominent position on a 
 grassy plot immediately in front of the old headquarters building it s inscridtion reads this monument marks the site of 
 fort osborne barracks 0:bar 0:racks home of princess patricia s canadian light infantry from april 1920 until their departure in 
 december 1939 for service in world war ii 
 the patrician 1998 139 during the summer we bade farewell to a few good friends in second battalion qmsi dave 
 and penny mcardle left for edmonton and dave s new job as rsm of first battalion and rsm ron cooke 
 has also gone to cowboy country as the new chief at the western area training centre wainwright we know he

 is looking for new challenges in ottawa we didn t 0:did 0:n 0:t see him and poppie as often as 
 we would have liked with all of the battalion s commitments but we really appreciated their support especially his very 
 well prepared and informative briefings mgen hewson doug bedford unveiling the new monument our 12th annual golf tournament at the 
 tuxedo golf course on august 28th was our best ever with 45 association and second battalion members and guests participating 
 our tournaments have been well supported lately by the wos sgts mess and the junior ranks club but this was 
 the first time in a few years that we ve had officers taking part and we even had a couple 
 of the gals playing elwood birss came all the way from dauphin and syd mckay from carman warrant officer don 
 hulan was the tournament s top player 0:play 0:er winning both the norman mccowan trophy for low net and the 
 president s cup for low gross 65 would you believe a few of the golfers had other commitments after the 
 game but we still mustered a sizeable group for the 19th hole barbecue at the wos and sgts mess a 
 series of substitutions resulted in our annual dinner on 17th of october being the night of the deputies second battalion 
 s co and rsm absent on duty were replaced on the guest list by dco major barry and mrs gesele 
 southern and qmsi larry and mrs carla surridge then the pmc was unable to attend and delegated the entertainment chairman 
 wo rick dumas in his stead finally 
 the patrician 1998 140 president jerry franc had to work late leaving vice president stu weeks and his wife bey 
 to host the affair however the second string coped very well and members and guests enjoyed a fine dinner 0:din 
 0:ner with old friends in the wos and sgts mess for nearly a decade second battalion s colours have not 
 been present during the annual remembrance service at all saints church as some members of the clergy and the congregation 
 objected 0:object 0:ed to the presence of armed soldiers in the church and our tradition requires the colours to be 
 properly escorted this year however the church agreed to accept the colours properly escorted and on sunday association members and 
 their spouses accompanied by second battalion s co rsm and reconnaissance platoon joined the congregation in the pews after the 
 opening hymn the colours were marched forward and presented at the altar and the colour officers and escort returned to 
 the rear of the church then the customary 0:cus 0:tomary last post lament silence binyon s verse and reveille during 
 the ensuing service the first lesson was read by the commanding officer lieutenant colonel matthew overton following the service association 
 and battalion members mingled with the congregation over coffee in the church hall the act of remembrance is obviously very 
 alive within the patricia family korea hall kapyong barracks drill hall could barely accommodate 0:accom 0:modate the second battalion association 
 and cadets on parade and the bleachers were overflowing with family members and friends at the annual remembrance service at 
 kapyong barracks on november 11th a highlight of the service was a moving rendition of in flanders fields by corporal 
 stacey bouck of the royal regina rifles a reservist on second battalion s bor staff it is worth mentioning 0:men 
 0:tioning here that corporal bouck was captain jim decoste s driver and was badly injured in the crash which took 
 his life in croatia in 1993 following the service in the drill hall association members accompanied by the battalion s 
 senior officers rsm and qmsi assembled at the kapyong monument where padre steve merriman conducted another brief ceremony and a 
 wreath was placed by world war ii veteran andy schaen and lieutenant colonel overton the election of officers during the 
 annual meeting on november 25th resulted in d arcy best being elected branch president replacing 0:replac 0:ing jerry franc who 
 had decided not to run for another term stu 
 the patrician 1998 141 weeks was re elected vice president and bob cumming has taken over the secretary treasurer s 
 duties our final event of the year was the second battalion junior ranks christmas dinner sixteen members 0:mem 0:bers of

 the patrician 1998 146 fraser valley branch after a busy summer for most members what with travelling to agms and 
 holidays etc our first meeting in september was a washout mostly because so many members were still on the road 
 enjoying the fabulous summer weather and returning from wherever october was a little better with most things back to normal 
 november was another re arrangement situation because our normal meeting evening coincided with remembrance day we had a good turnout 
 for the service from local members many of whom paraded with the branch 280 contingent bill wilkinson did his usual 
 fine job of carrying our branch colours in the combined colour party this was our first remembrance day parade without 
 the usual inclusion of a large number of personnel from the base with the closure of cfb chilliwack the only 
 regular force people on parade were the members from the local asu the significant event for december was our annual 
 branch christmas party considering the extent of the flu and colds going the rounds this fall we had a very 
 reasonable turnout with 23 people able to attend we had an excellent meal which was followed by our two lady 
 master joke tellers who helped everyone s digestion by keeping us all in fits of laughter till it was time 
 to go home we trust everyone enjoyed good holidays to wind up the year now we are all looking forward 
 to the 85th reunion in edmonton in july hope to see you there vancouver branch don parr pearson has been 
 quietly working for the past year on getting a plaque made to be placed on the walter mckaydraycott statqe which 
 sits on a bench in lynn valley park north vancouver draycott was a ppcli original who among other accomplishments was 
 responsible for drawing wartime panoramas of the ypres ramparts in may 1916 and vimy ridge 30 march 1917 although an 
 existing plaque tells of his many contributions to the city of north vancouver there is no mention of his military 
 service in the near future another plaque will be mounted on the bench which will read walter mackay draycott ppcli 
 ww i 1883 not forgotten 1985 donors to the project will be mentioned as well these were the

 at large are don parr pearson glen palmer charlie ball and don boyce in mid january we were saddened by 
 the death of mgen cammie ware a number of our members attended the funeral 0:funer 0:al service in victoria where 
 we met with members of the patricia family 0:fam 0:ily from across canada in paying our last respects to a 
 man who was one of the finest commanders of the regiment and a true supporter of all regimental matters until 
 his passing in early march 1999 we also suffered the loss of arthur kemsley a life long supporter and officer 
 of the regiment arthur was afforded military honours by over forty of our members later gordon henderson recalled arthur s 
 service and proposed a toast to his memory it appears that we will have a good turnout of our members 
 in edmonton where we look forward to meeting and greeting old friends and comrades from across the country patricia cabinet 
 in the seaforth officer s mess 
 the patrician 1998 148 victoria branch victoria is paying for a long hot summer with the wettest fall on record 
 just about the only wet day we had in july was wouldn t you know it the 4th when we 
 had our annual picnic the rain had an impact on attendance but those that did turn out had a good 
 time we held our regimental day in the bay street armouries on march 15th and although victoria is knee deep 
 in retired generals we decided 0:decid 0:ed to get mgen vernon down from comox as our guest of honour to 
 give the regimental toast bri bri as he was known to the work point typing pool when he was co 
 of 3 ppcli also gave a short speech that was well received our branch treasurer and national vice president jac 
 debruijne along with larry davies and harry miller went off to edmonton in june for the 3rd battalion change of 
 command 0:com 0:mand parade they had a good look at the edmonton facilities and were most impressed with what they 
 saw a new old face at our branch meetings is mgen herb pitts his duties official and honorary have had 
 him commuting between ontario and bc for many years so its nice to see him settle down as a permanent 
 resident of victoria and as i type this report i see on todays news a snow emergency in toronto so 
 i dare say he s glad to be here our local ppcli cadet corps were lucky in having a cadet 
 chosen to attend the 80th anniversary of the wwi armistice in europe the branch donated 100 00 for his personal 
 expenses on the trip and appropriately happy harry miller presented him with the cheque harry s son former ppcli skyhawk 
 and now somewhere in the edmonton base supply system was a cadet rsm of the corps there maybe some interest 
 among readers who have served at work point over the years to note that demolitions have taken place recently and 
 gone forever are base qm base maint trade pnrs jrc coy office building barber tailor shop and band shack adp 
 the boat people marpac are now busy constructing sailor type facilities on these sites for those like me who loved 
 to pound the parade square it will soon be gone also the finest soccer field in victoria according to ernie 
 grant converted to a parade square by 1 ppcli in 1957 is to become a ras replenishment at sea trainer
