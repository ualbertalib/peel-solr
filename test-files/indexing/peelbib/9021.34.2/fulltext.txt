 dennis houses of log or sod are commonly made wood frame houses at least a possibility associated with rural alberta
 in the early years from that time one one such sawmill was built of settlement however wood frame dwellings on
 the sturgeon river north of edmonton it was were also built at this time in addition to those jointly owned
 by the oblate mission of st albert built on site from building materials purchased and the lamoureux brothers also in
 1878 the from local lumber yards and local hardware federal government set up a sawmill on the castle stor es
 prefabricated or ready made houses river west of pincher creek known as mountain were at least a possibility by the
 early part of the mill it was later sold to senator peter mclaren twentieth century when he obtained timber rights
 in the area by wood frame houses generally became a feasi the l 880 s the lamoureux family had built
 ble alternative to the house of log or sod only sawmills at fort saskatchewan and stony plain after a supply
 of lumber and other store mclaiun had other sawmills at fort macleod and bought building materials became cheap and ac
 blairmore louis sands a michigan lumberman cessible such a supply took time in coming operated five sawmills in the cypress
 hills in sawmills had to be established railways built the calgary area the bow river mill owned by and lumber
 yards set up in villages and towns major james walker and the eau claire and finally the hard cash required
 for purehasing the bo river lumber company were becoming materials was something many settlers did not hriving businesses have until
 they had worked away from their land william gladstone an ex employee of the at some endeavour other than fanning
 or until hudson s bay company is claimed to be builder they had reaped a number of successful crops of
 alberta s first frame house no mention is prefabricated houses built in far fewer numbers made where and when the
 house was built to han their on site counterparts were purchased lend credence to the claim it is noted that
 gladby individuals who not only had the necessary stone arrived in alberta in 1848 he was an exfinancial resources to
 do so but who also had penenced carpenter builder and by the 1870 s and access to the advertising distributed
 by the corn early 1880 s when the first frame house might panies that sold the component parts have been
 built he was living in an area of to better understand the use of prefabricated alberta where some of the
 earliest sawmills were houses in rural alberta in the first decades of located he twentieth century one should first examine
 regardless of when or where or by whom the the development of wood frame houses in similar first wood frame

 890 s the two storey laycock house on a farm it is difficult to determine where or when the near
 calgary was photographed in 1886 and first frame houses were built in alberta it is possible the first ones were

 fellows in patent leather boots and baggy mon soldiers are servants for the officers and khaki riding trousers for which
 they have sent the only clue to whose identity is the arrival once all the way to england dashing up
 and down and in six months or so of a heavily crested letter running the whole show the indians standing

 will hear that the orderly the englishman doesn t insult or bully the indriving the trap is the son of
 a man who holds dian he simply ignores him and by pursuing a most prominent and responsible position in up
 a life as nearly as possible like the one he would per canada and they will tell you of even
 tragic lead in england and by appropriating whatever things of a private soldier of whom the officers suits his interest
 or fancy he makes the indian and other men know nothing except that he is understand it is his country
 he impressed that or was a gentleman and who will finally find fact upon him even in his games l

 one might naturally suppose that there do and he would strike out over the prairie a at least the indian
 would feel his superiority and derisive shout would go up from the spectators take advantage of it it is the
 young english and after a hard struggle the little indian would rancher who is most in evidence and who gets
 return slowly much abashed and disappointed up the events and purses and who races over his horse s peformance and
 the loss of the all his own horses first and regulates everything race he also had the unhappiness of knowing
 imagine a dusty uneven track in the middle of that by his failure to win his indian relatives the prairie
 a large and unique assemblage of had probably lost most of their available property men women and children in traps
 and on foot for the indian is a born gambler and will bet opposite on the other side of the
 track indians heavily whenever he has the chance dressedout in colours so brilliant that they make i had always heard
 dark and thrilling hints to one blink when the sun stnkes them and the effect that in england and eastern
 canada the shouting their weird ki ki whenever a good territories were considered an excellent place to piece of riding
 is done booths for pink lemonade send wild younger sons spendthrifts and proflia wooden structure for the starter s stand
 with gate young gentlemen whose families were sick a perpendicular ladder fastened against it up and of being beggared and
 disgraced by them at down which men clamber ceaselessly and with home but i had always disappointedly decided surpnsing agility
 and jockeys innumerable that after all it was too interesting to be true it lounging around little boys and half
 breeds and was in all probability one of those popular grown men and cowboys all shouting and ex fallacies that
 no one cares to explode but then changing bridles and bits and horses and above i had been told of
 one incurable young drunkard all the fierce dust and wind who in a fit of rage turned his old father
 who i do not suppose there was much scientific had come to see him and who was a man so
 well riding done or any record breaking but it was known and prominent that he was in danger of sufficiently
 interesting to watch the performances being knighted out of the house and left him of the bmncho as he went
 tearing around his lit there in the open prairie i heard of another who tle feet hardly seeming to touch
 the ground and treated his young wife so cruelly that when she more than making up in energy and endurance
 fell ill she persistently refused to see a physician what he lacked in size and later when the because as
 she explained she was only too gymkhana races began it was most exciting to anxious to die and quickly then
 i knew that watch a young man ride a tandem team the there were many young men out there who
 were leader of which insisted on jumping the enclosure regularly and well paid by their people to stay or standing
 up in the air and who could only be thee so i had to reconstruct my point of view got
 away at all by repeated efforts it was very and admit that the dark hints were well founded amusing to
 see several young englishmen urging the discovery so impressed me that i found their green ponies around the course in
 the teeth myself constantly wondering in the presence of of a regular gale and endeavoring to keep an um very
 nice and entirely innocent young englishbrella up and a cigarette lighted under such trying men what awful crime had sent
 them out to the circumstances north west territories the prettiest races were of course the indian of course there is
 the other side of the shield races where ten or twelve excited little indians one is glad to know that
 there is a large number some of them did not look to be more than six of young englishmen who
 go out there because or seven years of age lined up before the they think it will be a fresh
 and remunerative field starter s stand on the fastest ponies the indians for them because they can t find anything
 to do possessed and waited in breathless impatience in england and most frequently because for the pistol to be fired
 they of course rode western ranch life offers peculiar attractions to without saddles some without bridles only them it is
 so difficult to imagine a young halters and as they lay along the ponies necks american voluntarily choosing a ranch
 as a start gripping the flanks hard with their muscular little in life that it is hardly worth while trying
 to do knees they were so motionless and secure that so as a rule he either thinks of the country
 as they gave the impression of being fastened there the place where market vegetables come from by some invisible means
 sometimes one of the and thanksgiving turkeys are raised or else it ponies would get so excited that the keeping
 to represents to him a large and expensive establish 11 ment at lakewood or some such place with a cost
 appallingly out there and he will hang up casino and bowling alley and po lo team attached photographs of all
 his people and pictures of and as for the most part the american does not places he knows in england
 cut out of the play polo or hunt or shoot or fish with any real graphic or the illustrated london
 news and genuine enthusiasm the latter view he takes is fasten his old racing colours and po lo mallets scarcely
 more alluring than the former down above them then he will turn his attention to deep in his heart he
 knows that he would much buying cattle and getting together some good polo rather be trying to run an electric
 railway or a ponies and bronchos to fill his corral after that bank or building bridges or losing money in
 if he is really energetic he will go out on the wall street than to be doing any of those
 things round up and will get his first taste of severe but the young englishman is entirely different work he
 will probably be very stiff and sore he has always known and enjoyed outdoor sports from the long hard riding
 and the duty on the it is the life he likes best and he imagines that night shifts and sick
 and faint with the heat ranch life is first and foremost a sporting life anddust of the day and the
 odorof burning flesh he tells himself that he will have as much of it and agonized lowings of the cattle
 under the as he wants and all the freedom that he cannot branding iron and when all that is over
 and there get in england he is usually a very big young is nothing more exciting or interesting to be
 done man and england seems a little small for him he begins to absent himself a good deal on visits
 he feels that he has outgrown it as one outgrows to the nearest ranches and lets the overseer a suit
 of clothes and he wants to get another and whom he has left in charge entertain the chance a larger
 one and of the colour and shape that he visitor at his shack fancies he imagines that western canada will
 it is only fair to say that hospitality in northabout fit him and so he tells his people that he
 west canada means something different and more has decided to go out to the provinces and than with us ih
 the east we think we have been they give him a good deal of money and remark very hospitable when
 we make our friends welas they comfortably settle themselves back in come and give them the best we have and
 look their english home what a grand thing it is for politely gr ieved when they have to leave us
 to a young man to go out into the world they are go on somewhere else the young rancher in
 the glad he is at last going to do something for west takes you in whether he knows you or
 not himself and he starts off in joyful anticipation and if he happens to be away his shack is left
 of unlimited polo and shooting and riding and open and his overseer will do the honours for in total ignorance
 of all things he ought to know him you will be invited in and asked to help about ranching and
 all the hard work and poor yourself to anything you may fancy and to eat return ahead of him the
 nice things he has had the forethought to pro he does not know what a canadian winter vide himself with
 at great expense you will be means with snow four feet on a level for weeks treated generally as though
 you had been urged at a time and the thermometer dropping to 40 to come and your arrival anxiously awaited
 this and 50 degrees below zero he cannot realize is very pleasant for the stray traveller and it may beforehand
 what it is to have the cattle perishing be pleasant for the young rancher who enjoys exby thousands from this
 cold nor what they suf tending his hospitality but it isn t the way to fer from the heat and
 drought of the short hot make money he knows it and begins to feel summer nor the incessant work and
 close calcu slightly discouraged and the shack which had lation it takes to make any profits nor the at first
 seemed to him as fascinating as a new toy loneliness of the life before him will begin to pall on
 him and the photographs generally he goes out in the spring when the and pictures which he had liked to
 look at so country is at its best and he spends several much will bring a rush of homesickness to
 him months looking around and enjoying the open the first heavy snow will make him feel like a handed hospitality
 that is sure to be extended to prisoner and the next thing one hears of him is him and then
 after much advice has been given that his address is the nimrod or hurlingham him good and bad he will
 buy a ranch that will club and that he will be back in the spring cost him much more than
 he expected to give sometimes he comes back and sometimes he he will fit out the shack with an astonishing
 does not amount of tinned things and pans and dishes and if he does return and if ranching still proves
 lamps and even american chairs all of which unprofitable he will probably try a great many 12 not all successful
 by any manner of means what seemed to me an even better way to making a fortune quickly than investing
 in gold mines was to lend money there were men in alberta who were getting 25 per cent on their
 money and others who were borrowing capital in england at three per cent and lending it at twelve that struck
 me as being the grandest in dustry of the country but one can understand that furnishing london and chicago and
 new york with beef or even getting 23 per cent interest on one s money seems a tedious and unprofitable
 occupation when one might be getting a hundred thousand dollars a month out of a mine so a great many
 ranchers abandoned their places and went over into british columbia of course that is not the and rustle and slave
 away and perhaps achieve success but they are very few and success is very dear at least that is the
 way it seemed to me history of all of them some of them stick to it and what i have
 set down are only the things that struck me personally as being the most obvious and most true about the
 young englishman in canada there are shacks in the north west at least f c lnder owner of the north
 fork ranch typified you are told of them which have drawing rooms many of the well educated young englishmen who
 settled and long plate glass mirrors and grand pianos on ranches in the foothills of the rockies but i do
 not think i should like that kind at all things that would astonish his people if they knew if one
 is going to have all those things around of them there was one young englishman out one might as well
 be in london or new york there whom i knew of who had run through a at once and be
 done with it it is much more fortune by the time he was twenty chiefly delightful to live in the
 kind that are made of big through his habit of keeping open house and rough beams which are not even
 plastered over writing his name on checks that his friends drew on the inside but adorned according to one s
 up for him and who then tried to get back taste with exciting pictures from magazines and by keeping a
 livery stable after which unsuc plates from fashion books and coyote skins and cessful effort he became cook on a
 large ranch bridles and saddles and quirts and where one can and when i last heard of him he was
 on his way have a hammock slung across the room and the to british columbia to be bartender in a
 hotel horses can look in the door if they want to and while he speculated in gold mines at odd
 times one feels much more comfortable and much safer everyone had gold fever last summer in that to sleep with
 the fresh wind from the prairie part of the world breathless and perspiring polo sweeping through the open door and
 window and players would casually ask you as they shifted blowing the curtains about and a great dane the saddles
 on their ponies and knotted their beside your bed to shake himself and growl loosened sashes between quarters what would
 whenever a coyote howls too loudly or the ponies be a taking name for a gold mine they were think
 tramp too near the shack than in a house with ing of buying it gave one a very grand sensa
 yale locks to the doors and patent fastenings on tion to be on such familiar terms with gold mines the
 windows and a pnvate policeman to keep even if one were doing nothing more than guard besides the one regularly
 on the beat christening them but i never could quite under there are a great many shacks like that in
 the stand how speculations could be carried on suc north west and as they belong chiefly to young cessfully at
 such vast distances from the gold english ranchers who are most hospitably inclined fields and in point of fact i
 believe they were and who are always giving house parties and 13 gymkhana and polo parties one has a very
 good people who seemed to be having a very good chance of seeing them time and more young englishmen would
 come i think both the shacks and their owners are around impressively and ask you how you took at their
 very best when a house party is on the your coffee or tea and insist on serving you shacks to
 begin with are preternaturally clean themselves sometimes one of them would tell and the young englishmen most extraordinarily you confidentially
 that he hoped you would like polite and agreeable they do things on a large such and such a dish
 because he made it himself scale at these house parties six or eight there was indeed something almost pathetic englishmen
 who constitute a crack polo team in the way those big young men thought of the and who fortunately have
 neighbouring shacks comfort of their guests and stayed up till all invite 80 people with their traps and tents and
 hours of the night and turned out at unearthly servants and two other crack poio teams with hours in the
 morning they made the shacks pretty 30 or 40 polo ponies besides the horses they ride with all sorts of
 decorations and arranged for the or drive and the half breeds who bring the ponies pleasure and convenience of the
 women even and the indians who always turn up when one down to sending hot coffee to the tents while
 they reflects that all these people and horses are to stay were dressing in the morning after luncheon for two
 days and that the shacks are 70 miles although it was very cold and a strong wind was from a
 railroad and 35 miles from the nearest blowing we all went out to the polo grounds and town and provisions
 and a great many necessities watched one enthusiastic polo team completely one is divided between admiration for their use up
 another enthusiastic polo team and when hospitality and distress at all the trouble one is that had been accomplished satisfactorily
 we inevitably giving them and when as happened went back to the shack where dinner was presently in our case
 a regular blizzard came up and all served the 80 people and ponies and dogs and traps had that evening
 there was a dance and it was as to stay over 24 hours longer than they had been ceremonious and
 enjoyable a function as if it had expected to stay we wondered that the young taken place in park lane
 young men whom you englishmen did not rise in a body and politely had only seen in round up or
 polo clothes sudinvite us to go anyway but they did nothing of denly appeared in dress suits and immaculate the
 kind their politeness was more than equal shirt fronts and bore so little resemblance to their to the test and
 so they killed another steer and former selves that you felt that they ought to be cheerfully continued to help
 wash innumerable reintroduced and the young married women and coffee cups and plates and glasses and invented girls bloomed forth
 in low necked gowns and amusing games for us of course the majority satin slippes and had their dance cards
 which of the 80 people had to camp near the shacks were most properly got up and had the familiar
 as it was impossible to house them all silk cord and pencil attachment rapidly filled by it was a most
 delightful and unique sensation the metamorphosed young gentlemen the band to sit back comfortably in your trap which had which
 consisted of a violinist and a sergeantbeen drawn up to the camping ground and watch banjoist from the near est
 police detachment a genial young englishman take out the horses played very good dance music indeed and alterand send them
 to the stable while several other nated waltzes and two steps beautifully and equally agreeable young men ran up your
 bell there was a sitting out room with chinese tent and arranged your trunks and put up a stove lanterns
 and screens and things at twelve and hung a mirror to the tent pole and pitch o clock supper was
 served and one felt just as forked sweet fresh hay into a corner for a bed one did at home
 only with a queer difference and spread down the buffalo robes and blankets it was all so strange because it
 was all so familiar and after it was all finished most satisfactorily and it would have seemed much more familiar
 you were bundled into a trap which had just come if it had been more strange which is rather tearing
 down from the shack driven recklessly paradoxical but which ever yone will easily by another agreeable young host and so
 borne understand you have thoroughly prepared your triumphantly up the 200 yards between the tenting mind for very different things
 from any you have ground and the dining shack as if the distance known by recalling forcibly that there are
 one were too tremendous to be walked when you hundred thousand square miles of prairie about reached there you were
 ushered into a big room you and that you are 170 miles from the nearest that was filled with long
 tables and a great many place that can by any stretch of imagination be 14 naturally enough polo was a
 favourite sport of the english and canadian ranchers in the foothills above is a team on the roo dee ranch
 near pincher creek in 1899 called a city and the rockies are close upon you more patriotic subjects that those
 careless happy to the left this is a young country and a man young ranchers so many thousands of miles
 away who has been in it five years is an old settler in that lonely land who did not forget
 her even so one is rather astonished at the well bred people in their pleasures she would do well to
 stop going and at the daily mode of life which one naturally to balmoral and florence and the isle of
 wight connects with the east and city life and at the and come over to canada instead and hint around
 presence of a hundred trifles which one had until some of those young men invited her to a carefully prepared
 one s self to do without house party i am sure they would treat her nicely and then at about
 half past two when and that she would have a most delightful time ever yone was properly tired and sleepy
 the dance the second and last day was to have been very broke up and the traps which always seemed
 exciting with polo in the morning and gymkhana in some mysterious way to be standing around races in the afternoon
 but when we woke up we ready at any hour of the day or night drew up saw what the
 wind and dark clouds of the day to the door while the young women were in the before had meant
 although it was only dressing room putting on their wraps the young september 11 th the ground was thickly englishmen
 and canadians struck up god save powdered with snow and the flakes were falling the queen and sang it at
 the top of their young with an evident determination to keep it up for lungs and more fervently than i
 ever heard it sung some time at least so we dressed slowly and before it was a very fine sight
 i thought the discontentedly and the trap which had be sent big beamed shack the walls covered with polo down
 from the shack for us drew up with much and hunting and racing trophies half shining in forced gaiety and
 dash and we put on mournthe faint light from the sputtering candles and fully the raccoon coats that had thoughtfully
 been lamps burning low in the brackets and the sent with the trap and were carried back up to straight
 athletic young figures standing easily the shacks there was much anxious consultation about it seemed to me that the queen
 would over the weather during the morning and have been a very proud lady indeed if she could everyone felt
 greatly relieved when it cleared up have heard that song and known that she had no in the early afternoon
 and it was decided to have 15 the second poio match it was very hard to give cert as it
 was really the last night of the house up seeing the gymkhana with the postilion and party although a great
 number of the guests were bending and the bucket and ball races and the compelled to stay over another 24
 hours someone half mile hurdles over four jumps a nd all the rest got up and made a very complimentary
 speech of it but one was very glad to see the polo match on behalf of the 80 guests and
 thanked the north which proved very fast for two quarters at fork polo team for the delightful time they had
 least it began to snow in the third and by the given them and everybody cheered enthusiasfourth the ponies racing
 and turning sharply on tically and put on their wraps with great regret the wet slippery grass could hardly keep
 on their when we started back a day later thee were little feet and one could with difficulty see the
 six inches of snow on the ground and the cattle white khaki trousers and sweaters and make out were lowing

 a feeling of burning the smoke from the worst forest fires that superiority over that prodigal king for my enterhad

 it had been only mountains for weeks together which i took as one and the sunlight would filter in a
 sick a personal grievance but they also chose to burn grayish yellow colour through the rolling clouds up crow s

 the second kootenay lake because of ground near our shack and from that vantage there is a chain of them

 chain of lakes wrong end of an opera glass the feeling began as we dared with only the far off
 cry of a loon to grow on us at the outset of the long lazy or the soft whirr of
 a wild duck as it scurried low journey when we drove straight west over the across the water to break
 the silence the mounprairie with the horses going in their steady easy tains towered high all about us silver white
 in trot and the trap swaying gently on the thick the moonlight so that they looked like giant prairie grass
 and a misty blue and white mountain icebergs rising from the little sea making us feel peak in the distance
 to guide our cour se by that we were in some enchanted country and ranches and all the familiar places
 we had known when the moon sank behind some tall peak a melted away behind us and we wound higher
 and shadow fell upon the lake the wind sprang up higher up among the foothills with glimpses cold and strong
 we would turn the boat around downward of softly blended shades of green or and row back through the narr
 ow little waterways upward to snowy mountains or ahead the glint out into the big open lake and make for
 the white of yellowed grass ready to be cut and when we dots on the far shore which we knew
 were our reached the lake lying blue and warm and still tents then if it were not too late we
 would under the brilliant sun and breathed in the spicy build a big fire on the shore with great pieces
 of odor of the pines and realized that this undis fallen trees and the blaze would flare up as we
 covered country was all ours we felt very much gathered around it and sang the maple leaf like pitching our
 tents there for good of course the red river valley au clair de la there would have been some difficulty
 about living lune and l alouette anyone who has not there in the winter but no one troubled about that
 heard canadians sing these songs especially just then l alouette which requies a strong voice and i do not think
 however the beauty of the lake a great deal of breath and a wonderful memory appealed to some as much

 was very hard to break camp but the last was an object much more worthy of contempla day came and
 we retraced our way and again tion to some of us than the mountains around watched with breathless anxiety the
 heavy teams fortunately the two things could be combined crawl up the steep hills or plunge into the swift one
 could start out in the canoe with the trolling little streams and pull themselves up the rocky line and then
 if the fish did not bite the trip could banks it was all the harder to go back because be

 to name hoses and gold mines but it had seemed so remote for three months suddenly is even more unique

 a young broncho alternately plunging and difficulties not only all social intercourse but shying by their side attempt to cross
 a deep river at the same time that logs anywhere from ten to living itself would cease in north west

 accepted an invitation to afternoon tea at a ranch 14 mites are racing downstream to see which can first knock
 the horses down by neatly hitting them on away and on the other side of a very much swollen river

 lettuce sandwiches and ices and drank go to add to our personal difficulties the horses usually driven to the trap
 could not be used so chocolate just as we could and probably would have done if we had stayed at
 home and bravely that an obliging englishman had to offer to take went through all our exciting experiences again us
 to do so he had to drive 17 miles from his ranch to reach us rest his horses and take
 lunch on our way back it did not occur to us until some time afterward that we had really gone
 to a great eon with us before we could start on the real dea l of trouble to get to
 that afternoon tea journey but no one faltered in the stern deter but all that was over now there were

 moment it was before from far off there came the faintly heard discovered that the river was so high that

 cases eva dealt very firmly with her but she improved with time four weeks later she brother and the traffic
 came to an end however had to repack and go with harold to saskatoon the men continued to attend the
 services as they for his last term before the exams he passed had come to like harold for his own
 sake as they these satisfactorily and he was finally ordained found him to be genuine the sale of homemade on

 all over the district some in alberta hands and feet and not much physical strength and some in saskatchewan eva
 noticed that her but much courage she had been stranded by her brother terry always stowed some suitcases with employer

 maid to an old and at the other end someone always carefully lady when the woman s son began to

 always helped hardly any money tetence discovered her scrub suddenly eva had a suspicion one province bing a floor and
 weeping on one of his rare visits was wet and the other dry she questioned her to the town and
 on hearing her rather pitiful 21 story all of his chivalry came to the fore after boon during the 1914
 18 war when harold and some discussion they both decided that they eva entertained so many lonely service men should
 get married and build up something good in 1914 mrs ard whose sons had gone out out of their own
 private ruins terence took her with terence in the earlier days sent a huge back to harold and eva at
 the mission house donation of 2 500 the parishioners were and there she stayed until the wedding it proved spurred
 to action and when relations and english to be a lasting and happy marriage which stood friends of eva and
 harold sent more there was the test of many vicissitudes sufficient to pay off all debts the bishop was meanwhile
 eva continued to learn about fron very pleased however there were further extier life on the sunday after thanksgiving day
 penses in 1915 when one of the church walls she and harold visited a newly opened mission needed to be
 strengthened and a parish hall built about twelve miles away it was snowing hard soon after the edwards arrived in
 vermilion and no one got to the service excepting harold my father realised that there were two jewish and one
 family they suggested the couple to families in the town each with a large number stay over until the next
 day or start back at once of children who were getting no religious instruc they chose the latter as they
 knew that harold s lion at all he was very concerned about them aunt who was ‘ ut on a
 visit from england and but didn t think the families would welcome a eva s brother terry would get very
 anxious if christian cleric poking his nose in but mother they were late or missed the pleasant valley serv was
 partly irish and had no such inhibitions next ice at 3 p m so they had to face the blizzard
 and time she went to moses wener s store she tackled soon the trail was obliterated no fences for miles
 him you are a good jew she said why to guide them suddenly the nearside horse went don t you
 give your children proper instruction head first into what must have been one of the in your faith deep holes
 which marked the homestead boun mr wener was visibly concerned i believe daries they had an extremely difficult time in
 he said and in my heart i know you are right digging him out as only a bit of his
 tail was visi but jam no teacher besides i am a russian and ble getting him home was worse still
 but he do not read the english so well my children must would have frozen to death if left he
 had to be learn their history and faith in english and some thrashed to get him to move even though
 there in hebrew perhaps some day a rabbi will was no visible injury their second horse a small come eva
 thought about it very earnestly and indian cayuse with the grit of a hero dragged after a few days she
 rather timidly suggested that the sleigh and old pinto along with eva pushing she or her husband should teach the
 family the the sleigh and sinking to her knees in soft snow old testament mr wener and his english wife
 with every step whilst harold dealt with the ufl were overjoyed and so regular bible classes were fortunate pinto and
 kept him on his feet started eva found the children extremely bright however frost bitten fingers and a toe or
 so was and discovered she gained a greater insight into all the injury they got her own christian beliefs by
 studying the old in 1913 harold was offered the parish of st testament with them she used to make the
 saviour s at vermilion which had a huge debt stories come so alive and vivid that the children of over
 4 000 and a two roomed shack for a rec were enthralled i believe she taught the children tory the
 first rector had had a lambeth palace regularly until she left vermilion in 1923 consisting of a one roomed timber
 shack for his years later i received the following letter from rectory soon afterwards he or the rector who jacob
 wener followed him had built another shack of the same you have brought back many pleasant memories size and attached
 it to the side of the first when of your parents they were wonderful people i will harold took over
 he and eva dragged the two never forget them there were only two jewish sheds apart and gradually as funds
 for materials families in vermilion moses wener and abraham wener and their families your father and mother felt permitted they
 built a two storey addition in the badly at the lack of a rabbi and our chance of getcentre thus
 making the building symmetrical ting a religious training they invited all of the and as a friend said pleasing to
 the eye the children of both families to come to their sunday fact that it had a staircase fascinated many
 a school classes and said they would teach us only from the old testament so on sundays we all went
 to sunchild who spent most of the time going up and day school when the old testament was being taught
 down up and down whilst the parents were we joined in with the church members but when the visiting certainly
 the larger rectory was a great new testament was being taught we were taught by 22 your mother in the
 rectory she was a wonderful every sort of game playable in a not very large teacher and gave us a
 background of our religious house they squeezed in about thirty men and for lack of not enough tables they knelt
 on the a true christian floor and used upturned buckets for the games my father operated a very busy and
 successful the men both officers and ranks sent a petition general store in vermilion until he retired in 1945 to
 their colonel asking him to appoint harold as his brother abraham had a bakery and in front of his their
 chaplain store was his confectionery and ice cream parlour then as acting chaplain harold was told to during the first
 world war one of the troop trains report to saitee camp at calgary in 1916 when stopped at vermilion which
 was a divisional point and the boys ran from the train to the ice cream parlour the vennihon contingent was
 recalled there but and bakery where two of the girls were working your he was warned that he would be
 without pay or mother came into the store and when she saw how uniform until they all had sailing orders
 when busy they were she started to help them do you these finally came the colonel told harold that remember
 what a trap door to the basement is it is a personal friend had applied for the post and that
 a door in the floor to give access to the basement the trap door had been left open suddenly my
 cousin the colonel was giving it to him as harold had rose asked ‘ where is mrs edwards your mother
 resigned from vermilion and stored his furniture had disappeared she had fallen down through the the young couple felt that
 the only thing to do opening into the basement with a full tray of dishes was to get to england
 and for harold to try for thankfully she wasn t hurt a chaplaincy there it took all their savmgs to
 pay my father came from russia as a young man and settled in nova scotia he married my mother a
 girl for the fare and when they amved he had no born in leeds england my father came west to
 ver luck however archdeacon lloyd was also in milion in 1909 got settled in business there and england and he
 offered harold the job of organbrought the family west in 1910 i zing a society called the maple leaf encour
 we have never forgotten your parents we have on aging anglican recruits to go to western canada as preachers when
 peace came to do this meant kindness to us and where and how we got the basis preaching and lectunng
 all over england at the of our religious training my cousins who live here same time he was able to
 visit scores of wounded in edmonton feel the same way too canadians from saskatchewan and alberta in in 1915 a
 battalion was stationed for training english hospitals and write letters for them back near vermilion harold and eva got to
 know a home to their folks in canada great many of the boys and once a week had an while
 in england eva found that at long last evening service followed by refreshments and she was going to have a
 baby she went to her d above is a view of the anglican church and rectory at vermilion in the
 teens the rectory was enlarged by separating two small shacks and building the two storey house between them 23 parents

 prayer accidents and had no place for maternity cases in 1920 father was allowed to have an assistbut eva told
 them that as she had been married ant in the parish this was because he was now for seven years
 one might call this baby an acci mral dean over a very large area as well as being dent so
 i became the first baby to be born in the rector of st saviour s thus j h smith was

 weeks previously that she would never be course was able to do much of the visiting able to have a
 child she had tried to comfort mother also visited and occupied herself with the herself by thinking that children were
 nuisances women s auxiliary this left father with far and that no sane woman would want to bring up more
 time to go round the outlying districts taking a child on the prairie thus when harold eagerly services where necessary
 but still taking all comburst out with his news elsie exclaimed what munion services and also weddings baptisms a misfortune
 and smashed a plate on the floor and funerals in vermilion before running outside to cry the poor dis after
 the war father started a small newspaper heartened harold rode slowly home however called the link to keep the various

 debts which he did slowly but surely medicine and the matron was at her wits end paying the creditors who
 made a fuss last and amongst others father lay at death s door the less demanding creditors first mother was
 in the rectory praying for a miracle in 1919 terence m keone realised that the when she heard a knock
 at the door there stood loneliness of the prairies plus the severe winter a very hard bitten old character with
 a pareel weather and strenuous life was far too much for wrapped up in sacking i hear tell padre s
 his little wife therefore in the following year dying he said well i got the best medicine the great move
 was made the homestead was for nigh everything it would shake the angel sold all the horses chickens cows farm

 of jasper as its first wept with joy as she accepted the iicit whiskey fully resident rector he accepted with
 enthusiasm she asked no questions from whence it came and and even the news that there was no rectory failed

 room 24 did not hold us for very long my father rented and silver teapot and dispensed afternoon tea a
 flat from the taylors within a very few weeks the englishman said that he was just looking while we were
 in the church tower an amusing round but he showed great interest in the plans thing happened mother wanted a
 day off from of the parish harold full of enthusiasm told settling in and found that she could hire a
 horse how he had procured an excellent site for the from the brewsters which would carry the two future church
 the log church would soon be too of us plus food for all having ordered the horse small so when
 money was raised to build a new she was a bit surprised to find it tied up outside church the
 present one would become a parish the church at 8 a m minus a saddle however hall a few weeks
 later father learned that an off we went for our picnic at about 4 p m anonymous donor had given
 enough money for mother took the horse back to brewster s stable the new church because he said the rector
 and and was surprised to find that he balked at enter his wife were people who were not ashamed of

 so ding present there was such a huge crowd at had been retaken to the stable the station that it
 was difficult to get on as the however after this bad start in the parish we train started all the
 steam locomotives in the yard settled down very happily my parents got to blew their whistles and even the dogs
 howled know the parishioners and planned for a plot of that was the send off by the ailway boys land
 where the rectory should be built the work when we first came to jasper here was no was the best
 example of kindness and skilled co electricity and most people seemed to think it operation that they had ever met
 the congrega might be years before it came however it was tion could not afford to pay for labour but
 they cheaper and easier to wire a house before it was did supply materials and so haold decided to lined
 so father did his own work after much build the rectory himself one day a man passing studying of an
 electrical manual billy wachter through jasper came to ask for work but father an ex service man who had followed
 father from had to refuse as he had no money vermilion studied from the same manual and huh do you
 call yourself a carpenter said also did his wiring by trial and error however the man you re a cabinet
 maker he in he soon became so skillful that he became a much trusted park electrician sisted on helping that
 day in return for his meals and a sha kedown for the night water was the next luxury that jasper
 got alex many people gave half days or more of their wylie had been the park water carrier he had
 time mr taylor a roman catholic mr shepp first come to jasper as a guide and packer with herd a
 presbyterian and several anglicans in the foley survey party who were looking for a cluding two boys from the bank
 all put in time route for the future grand trunk pacific railway mother was quite handy with hammer and nails
 in the summer of 1909 as the town increased and i used to climb the ladder and pass the nails
 in size he began to haul water to most of the up one day mother was shingling he roof when
 householders during the winter in summer the an englishman in very english city clothes paused water ran in pipes on
 top of the ground until the at he foot of the ladder and asked her if she knew mains were
 put in alex had a wagon in the fall where the rector was mother descended took then a sleigh tank
 in the winter as soon as there the unexpected visitor to the one part of the house was enough snow
 for the sleighing that had a oof and was slightly furnished and finally the day came when the water system
 yanked father away from the future sitting room was turned on after about three days of sheer which he was
 meticulously flooring she hurriedly bliss there came a morning when there was not changed her br eeches for a dess
 a nd arrived a dop in the faucets it was soon discovered that with a tray bearing her treasured porcelain
 cups the beavers had objected to the scheme and had 25 wedged a log into the upper end of the
 pipe which for two attendants who between them do all the work took the water from the lake after it
 was re on that particular coach including cooking the meals we were six altogether the bishop his chaplain mr moved

 green representing the railway and who the pipe and against the flow of the water it too was in charge
 of all the arrangements and myself was removed by the park authorities and another it takes about an hour and
 a half to reach jasper from brule so we had plenty of time for breakfast and a grid was put
 over that end and he beavers were good chat of old times at st pauls we were passing finally defeated
 through the most wonderful scenery and i was able father always kept in touch with his two aunts to point
 out things of especial interest connected with the early explorers through the mountains in england here is a letter he
 wrote on oct 3 1926 to his aunt emma i remember that mother and i were on the plat there
 were two outstanding events this summer form when the official party arrived at jasper and which i think will interest
 you one was a cavell that the bishop was very sweet to me after one memorial service and the other
 the bishop of lon or two presentations they drove off to the lodge don s visit the former was held
 on the first sunday in august the whole congregation which numbered in one of their cars mr o brien the
 manager this year between two and three hundred have to go who was a roman catholic had kindly promised twenty
 miles into the heart of the mountains over a that he would put one of the best bungalows at road
 that is a wonderful feat of engineering in the the bishop s disposal and he was as good as his
 course of which we actually rise three thousand feet word father s letter continues the last two miles have to
 be done on foot as there is as yet no oad only a single pack trail winding we found that
 the two newest bungalows at the far through century old trees through which the most end of the lake situated
 amongst some fine old trees wonderful views are constantly had down the astoria on a little high knoll with a
 clear view across the lake right into b c in one spot the whole fraser glacier to mount cavell had
 been set apart for the use of the source of the great fraser river coming into view himself and party
 there are four bedrooms in each the actual spot chosen for the service is at the foot bungalow so the
 members of the party were able to of the angel glacier on mount cavell and it is really be just
 as quiet as they wished after their long train a mosi awe inspiring place even from the spot on joumeywithoutabreakfmmwinnipeg
 eachbungalow which we stand and which is six thousand feet above had a pleasant lounge and verandah and each sea
 level and three thousand feet above the town here bedr oom had its own bathroom the mountain rises in sheer
 precipices not slopes there is a wonderful golf links at the lodge and but sheer precipices for more than a
 mile above our they all felt that a little exercise would be good so heads and the summit is always
 crowned with a mass after a hurried change we repaired to the links where of dazzling white snow there grouped
 about on the i carried the bishop s clubs as i had done 30 year s blocks and masses of
 stone which have been deposited ago he used not to have so many then the bishop in years gone by
 by the glacier the people sit and won easily against his partner major brewster he stand during the short service
 my organist conducted really played a very good game doing one hole in two the singing of the hymns as
 otherwise in so vast an which was the first time that it had been done by area it would be
 impossible to keep together the anyone excepting the resident professional it is a good members of the orchestra at the
 lodge very kindl y 5 miles walk round the full eighteen holes and every gave up their sunday afternoon holiday
