 pounds alberta history spring 1995 fl the obvious question is whether a more powerful motor would have lifted the 0
 aircraft from the ground and achieved heavier than air flight in canada a full u ti two years before john
 mccurdy made his historic flight in the silver dart in calgary a sixteen year old boy named alfred e lauder
 had his own ideas about flight as early as 1906 he had conducted experiments with kites and concluded if a
 kite could be carried aloft by the air currents why couldn flying machine be made along kite like lines with
 proper motivation such a machine would offer stability and manoeuvrability young lauder felt that the biplane and double propellers were
 as part of their experiments the unreliable and that a successful underwood brothers flew the machine aeroplane should be a
 monoplane with a as a kite the first test taking place in single propeller august of 1907 five sacks of
 wheat were placed on the platform and were these observations together with his lifted without difficulty a short time own
 ideas for a flexwing machine he later john underwood mounted the submitted in 1908 to the famous while pilots offered

 ideas in the minutes swaying gently at the end of a bulletin of their research group the waited below for

 states and agreed to install it in time to fly their machine at stettler s first fair on october 1
 st and 2 nd 1907 however they encountered trouble with the custom s office in calgary and the encouraged by
 the reaction to his plans engine was never received as a result lauder prepared a small model of his the
 boys simply placed their invention flexwing machine early in 1909 and on display at the fair and did not attempt
 successfully flew it as a kite he then to send it aloft even then the aircraft used this model as
 the basis for a full was the centre of considerable interest 2 scale machine and with assistance from fourteen year
 old j earl young he built after the fair the boys bought a seven a flexwing twenty feet long with
 a horsepower motorcycle engine which canvas surface are 5 of about two they installed and attached to a four hundred
 square feet in appearance it bladed bamboo and canvas propeller was like a large tailless kite with struts the motor
 proved to be grossly under extending down from the nose and powered and the aircraft succeeded only centre these were
 attached to a in taxiing around the open farmyard horizontal frame the rear part of which the inventors then removed
 the motor was attached to the tail end of the kite and continued to use the machine as a kite
 however during 1908 a strong when the flexwing had been completed wind tore the craft loose from its anchor the
 boys had no motor so they tried to fly and destroyed it 3 it as a kite the machine was
 taken to a alberta history i spring 1995 flat prairie north of the bow river on the came forward with
 the necessary morley trail where j j young the father assistance of one of the boys provided the necessary pulling
 power with his 20 by 1909 seldom a week passed without horsepower buick the cable was a alberta daily newspapers
 carrying a 500 foot length of clothesline rope front page story about aviation activities which was laid out on the
 ground as the in the united states or europe while a flexwing was towed along it rose easily few local
 people like the underwood upper left into the air and when the automobile brothers and alfred lauder made honest reached

 machine reached an were carried away by their own dreams aircrqft in 1907 but could never get a altitude of
 between a hundred and two motor strong enough to power it hundred feet 6 it is seen here in stettler
 convinced of the soundness of their below ideas the boys made further tests and this rare 1909 snapshot shows some
 during july of 1909 alfred lauder took calgary boys with a device which flew his place as pilot under the
 flexwing s as a kite but required a motor which frame at the sound of a whistle the car they
 didn have in the white shirt is started off while lauder holding the the first such public incident occurred its
 inventor alfred laude r while at left device over his head ran along until the on sept 7 1909 when
 an edmonton earl young car reached towing speed however the carpenter reginald hunt made the automobile s horsepower proved surprising
 claim that he had built an inadequate for a sustained flight aeroplane and successfully flown it for although with lauder
 as passenger the thirty five minutes furthermore he said flexwing succeeded in rising a few feet it was powered by
 a gasoline engine of off the ground lauder described these his own making if true this was indeed as long
 frog hops t while young stated a remarkable feat when only a few that lauder left the ground for a
 months earlier canada s first aeroplane distance of over 500 yards and for a flight made by james mccurdy had
 period of 30 to 60 seconds 9 lasted less than two minutes the edmonton journal gave the story front lauder
 thus became the first person in page prominence and published a calgary to leave the ground in a heavier photograph
 as convincing proof that the than air glider he also was the first in alberta to be towed aloft by
 a moving vehicle but he had not flown a short time later the boys installed a tiny 1 1 4
 horsepower motorcycle engine in the flexwing but if the buick had been underpowered the motorcycle engine was even more inadequate
 and was barely able â€˜ to turn the flexwing s propeller the young inventor realized he would need a more
 powerful motor to elevate â€˜ the machine and lacking the necessary â€˜ â€˜ funds he appealed to the editor of
 the â€˜ calgary albertan for help suitably impressed the editor wrote an appeal entitled a chance for calgarians the model
 can fly he stated it leaves the ground it stays in the air as long as it has some force
 behind it but the young man needs engine and some other equipment however no one alberta history i spring 1995
 airborne machine had really for a larger model as a result the existed 2 reporter who interviewed him had not
 actually seen the machine upon closer examination however the story became a year later when baden was arrested less than
 convincing the for trying to defraud the bank of reporter had not actually seen commerce he was described as u
 1 the aeroplane for although it somewhat demented and died two had supposedly made a years later his family was
 adamant in b successful flight hunt said stating that no aeroplane had ever he had dismantled it and now existed
 except in the confused mind of required funds for a larger its inventor machine also he brought forward no witnesses
 who the next questionable flight took place had seen the flight and in 1911 in a unique canadian built although
 he claimed he had aircraft built in victoria by william worked on the machine in wallace gibson he first invented
 a six edmonton for three years his cylinder four cycle air cooled engine directories for that period the machine according
 to hunt s ii e 11 description was winged device with two great bird like wings on either side name
 does not appear in the city built so that the wings and artificial feathers would glide themselves the propeller was
 a fan like affair similar to those used to keep flies from sleeping in restaurants s yet this description in
 no aircraft which appeared in the journal in way matched the photograph of the sturdy the end even the picture
 proved to be i tl r false it showed henry farman making a record flight in france in 1908 except
 and during the winter of 1910 11 he for the questionable newspaper story no created the gibson multi plane the

 where an aircraft 1911 they arrived just in time to see that when they reached the ranch the jaap extricating
 himself from the ruins aircraft was reassembled by gibson was successfully built and flown of the aeroplane and myself and
 wrecked in test flight the reporter was provided with the in alberta prior to world war following description of what
 had happened one while attempting to make a landing from a height of over 100 feet in the air alex
 japp sici crashed down into a swampy coulee near this city it is strange that gibson invited the press and
 narrowly escaped death and then did not wait for them before making his tests at this date one can his
 machine was badly wrecked only assume that some kind of attempted japp who had flown about a mile in flight
 took place but if it reached the a test flight miscalculated the ground level of success described by gibson we

 s jury determined the cause of death to be by suicide while being under mental an n a ivi a

 morality was concerned to the point of overwhelming desperation he had been in charge of the police were often reluctant

 s stables until alcoholism had to enforce the law and often more appropriate motto for the pioneer cost him his
 job thereafter his only policemen themselves maintain the income came from a lodger in his house compromised in favour of
 right had a meaning all its own which named james donaldson often had little to do with either politics or
 the law these were the men charged donaldson had been having an affair maintaining order â€˜ â€˜ with the maintenance
 of what their with gillies wife for a number of years bureaucratic superiors idealistically gillies was well aware of this
 and had called law and order through their frequently quarrelled with his wife over experiences the mounties came to the
 matter about three weeks before understand that the real often differed gillies death donaldson had thrown from the ideal and
 that law and order him out of his own house when gillies were not necessarily synonymous had discovered the lodger
 in bed with concepts the cases which the mounties his wife tackled were varied often complex and seldom black and
 white charles gillies was not a man to keep his problems private especially when the tatting and feathering of james
 drink loosened his tongue and he donaldson in lethbridge in 1895 repeatedly complained to others about exemplifies the conflict between
 the law his domestic troubles consequently his and moral justice the case caused a situation was well known among the
 public sensation on the local and even townspeople and not a little national level being the topic of indignation had
 been aroused by the newspaper columns across the country treatment which the husband in order to fully understand the reasons
 complained of having received in the for the public outrage one must begin end his frustrations with his wife with
 with a separate but related case the donaldson and with his creditors had suicide of charles gillies finally driven him
 over the edge i ll alberta history i spring 1995 9 9 4 ter justice 1 end this he said
 he sought out his winchester carbine placed the barrel into his mouth and pulled the trigger 5 the funeral was
 held on february 15 th at which time donaldson committed what the townsfolk saw as the final outrage he attended
 the last rites as chief mourner in his special report to the commissioner superintendent r burton deane of the north
 west mounted police in lethbridge had already stated that there has been an unusual amount of indignation aroused by the
 manner in which he ie donaldsonl has treated the deceased 6 the entire town had known gillies lot well and
 the gall displayed by donaldson in this final insult had fired their righteous indignation in fact deane reports that there
 is a general the same time the gang left town some expression of wonder that he gillies 7 time later
 the pair were startled by the did not kill the other man instead front door smashing in according to retribution
 was clearly on the town s maxwell donaldson a gang of masked agenda men rushed in with firearms and what
 superintendent deane referred to ordered us to throw up our hands or we above as an unprecedented occurrence of should
 be shot covering us with the this water colour of a mounted lynch law took place the night of firearms
 at the same time the gang policeman was painted in the sumnmer gillies funeral 8 plans had been made which
 numbered about seven or eight of 1896 just a year after the tar and earlier in the day and the
 self appointed dispersed itself through the house with feather incident avengers set out for donaldson s home one man in
 the kitchen another in the around midnight 9 it was as they say a kitchen doorway and the remainder in
 dark and stormy night with the wind the front room where the donaldsons howling and the snow flying after the
 had been sleeping james was pulled shooting james donaldson had moved from the bed onto the floor and his light
 in with his brother maxwell the was extinguished the masked men donaldson brothers had retired at about said james stripped
 off my drawers alberta history spring 1995 but not my shirt rolled me on the floor the gang who had
 been giving all the and put tar and feathers on me from my orders commanded smith henderson waist downwards on
 my head and face and fraser to fall in line which they and on my arms and hands maxwell did
 donaldson had been blindfolded and remained on the bed at gun point meanwhile the gang continued their attack on donaldson
 the rope around the attackers became violent when the his neck was tightened enough to choke tarring and feathering was
 done the him apparently to prevent him from lamp was relighted and james still saying anything to the approaching lying
 on the floor was hit in the head men according to donaldson the man and a rope with a slip
 knot was placed who was on my left hand struck me around his neck the attackers then with his fist
 on the corner of the left eye donaldson had been having an dragged him by the rope into the kitchen
 the wound bled freely the blow to the and told him they were going to take head knocked me down
 they dragged affair with gillies wife for a him outside he was given his clothes me a piece and kicked
 me then igot on and ordered to dress they then dragged my feet again and we went on james out
 the door lifted him to his number of years gillies was well feet and began walking toward the the procession
 reached the lethbridge lethbridge house he was warned not house without further incident and aware of this and had frequently
 to yell or he would be gagged approached the front door donaldson was thrown into the barroom and the quarrelled
 with his wife over the the procession made its way along the doors were barred from the outside to dark
 snowblown streets into town and prevent him from going back out matter was met along the way by three men
 according to charles bulger who was william henderson peter smith and tending bar at the time the rope around donald
 fraser their sworn testimonies donaldson s neck became caught in the state that they had no involvement in the door
 and donaldson asked the tarring and feathering yet their bartender to help him bulger removed presence on the streets at
 such a late the rope from his neck and after pulling hour and in such bad weather is at the
 at the door for some time managed to very least suspicious the leader of get it open the bartender says
 j donaldson complained of having been knocked about a good deal but that beyond a little blood on his face
 he did not show any marks of violence the gang had dispersed by the time donaldson came out again there
 was nothing left for him to do but go home and some parties who met him on the way mistook
 him for an indian with war paint on 6 he did however reach home without further harassment maxwell donaldson had
 been told by the leader of the gang before he left that two armed guards would remain to make sure
 he did not move from his bed for at least twenty minutes thus maxwell was unable to reach superintendent deane
 until 1 15 am deane called sergeant james hare at the town police station and discovered that alberta history i
 spring 1995 james donaldson had already gone home the incident was over and the perpetrators had disappeared before the police
 were even made awa re of what had happened ideane knew that the circumstances of the case would make it
 virtually impossible to prosecute first there was no chance of catching the perpetrators redhanded maxwell donaldson had remained in his
 house for about twenty minutes after his brother had left and it did not take twenty minutes for the gang
 with james to reach the lethbridge house 7 thus the masked gang was long gone before maxwell could even leave
 home second the weather conditions had his presence in lethbridge was most made patrolling that night impossible certainly not welcome
 herefused to on the surface it seemed that the police file a complaint against his attackers had no way of
 learning about the and left lethbridge three days after he incident while it was happening was tarred and feathered a
 noisy crowd however they did have foreknowledge turned up at the station for his departure of it making deane s
 initial exoneration and hooted and jeered as the train of the mounties at the very least pulled out questionable the
 day before the tarring and feathering deane wrote tar and historian r c macleod has made the feathers have been
 mentioned in observation that minor incidents of connection with donaldson s name for mob action pa rticularly those where there
 has been an unusual amount of the offenders had gained public indignation aroused against himl 8 sympathy were difficult for
 the nwmp 21 deane either did not take the threat very to handle the tarring and feathering of seriously or
 did not want to involve the james donaldson provides an especially police at that early stage this may be good
 illustration of the extent to which taken as further validation that deane public sympathy could cause difficulties real sympathies lay
 with the for the nwmp in enforcing the law l perpetrators in any case the mounties e neither prevented the
 incident nor were superintendent deane was fully aware this is lethbridge house where they able to catch the men in
 the act of the connection between the suicide of donaldson was locked up after being finally james and maxwell donaldson
 charles gillies and the attack on james tarred and feathered it is seen here the only sources of information donaldson
 two days after the tarring with its boarders in 189 regarding the incident were reluctant to and feathering he wrote
 top give any details which might be useful for prosecution besides their attackers i have recently learned what was the
 donaldson was pushed down this street had been masked and could not easily immediate cause of this attack on and
 into lerhbridge house which is be identified deane concluded that it donaldson it seems to have been about halfway down
 on the right is clear we can get no information worth brought about by his going to gillies s mentioning
 from the donaldsons family funeral as chief mourner i was told above and it is very unlikely that a prosecution
 the boys could not stand this william henderson owner of the will succeed pharisaic proceeding lethbridge house encountered the tar
 and feather gang and was obliged to deane s suspicions were confirmed the attack on donaldson became an accompany them
 to his hotel james donaldson got the message that instant public sensation the words alberta history i spring 1995 public
 sympathy do not begin to treatment of gillies was well known and convey the extent to which the local viewed
 with great public contempt the community supported the attackers tarring and feathering of donaldson was even deane who had been
 in a subject of conversation both before lethbridge for some time was and after it occurred impressed by the extraordinary
 expression of public approval that was faced with such massive repugnance it evoked by the act 3 is not surprising
 that james donaldson should have wanted to leave town as it would be impossible to find the verdict among the
 citizens of quickly as he did in fact his departure lethbridge was vocal and absolutely had been the intended end
 of the attack in this town even six men who unanimous james donaldson deserved he had literally been treated to
 a what he got and the men who tarred and coat and told to â€˜ git superintendent would convict the
 prisoner or feathered him had done well deane was deane who spoke to donaldson before not the only one who
 remarked on the his departure commented on his any other persons concerned for complete absence of any condemnation situation of
 the attack william hutton said i this offence came up town the next day and every james is afraid of
 his life to stay in the person i met talked about this business place ie lethbridgel or to go out
 in ie the tarring and featheringi every the daytime and wants to leave for person seemed to think it was
 a good eastern canada tonight he says he is thing henry howard went to the shunned by everyone and no
 one will lethbridge house the next morning and speak to him not even members of a heard a great many
 talking about what fraternal society to which he belongs had taken place there were perhaps 20 people in the lethbridge
 house the ostracism james donaldson laughing about it they seemed to think experienced could not have been more it was
 rather a good thing to have complete in fact he was so utterly done walter whitney said that i ostracized
 that even those he considered have never heard any one single body his friends condemned him walter say that it
 was an outrage nor was whitney on donaldson s departure anyone particularly shocked that such a remarked that donaldson shook
 hands thing had happened donaldson s with me the night he was leaving and said i was the best friend
 he had in the country i think he deserved what he got it didn t hurt him any that i
 seen even the town s ministers thought the â€˜ attack on donaldson had been a good thing ministers of religion
 while deprecating mob law are of opinion that donaldson was well served and the pity is that it was not
 kept out of the newspapers the universal contempt felt for donaldson precluded any immediate attempts to bring the offenders to
 justice superintendent deane wrote it is difficult for outsiders to understand the state of feeling in this place on this
 question a few nights ago i was told that i was not supposed to be very keen alberta history i
 spring 1995 on brin ing the perpetrators to managed to extract justice a local merchant when told hare s confession
 he may have to testify in the case said he would tell the truth whereupon the i must say here
 that suggestion was made that he should be i had at the time ie tarred and feathered for not consenting
 before the macleod to commit perjury the preliminary triall sufficient examination of the case revealed this evidence to convict â€˜
 â€˜ local bias with glowing clarity deane sergeant hare who heard the preliminary examination under the police a was convinced
 that act it was in my power to prove that it would be impossible to find in this he was
 seen town even six men who would convict immediately at the the prisoner or any other person dispersion of the
 concerned for this offence even gang masked and though the strongest possible evidence d i 5 g u i s

 to choice between obtain a fair and impartial trial in this telling what he case before a lethbridge jur y

 to have him shield him so far as tried in macleod the trial was held in the lay in my
 power from first week of july any penal consequences he had no intention of placing hare on the stand initially
 james donaldson had been so being convinced that were it known in terrified of retaliation that he refused to lethbridge
 that hre was a turncoat file charges against his attackers there his life would be in danger however would have
 been no case at all but for the counsel for the crown g e p outside forces which made themselves
 conybeare had some reason to suspect felt commissioner lw herchmer was that sergt hare knew all about the not happy
 at all about the incident and business at least told me that he had rebuked deane for having done nothing
 determined to put hare in the box to prevent the tarring and feathering conybeare convinced deane to let him lef
 t he demanded that the police lay speak to hare and after receiving charges in addition james donaldson s reassurance
 from conybeare hare view of lethbridge in 1890 with the father wrote to deane and insisted on finally agreed to
 testify lethbridge house doniinating the the offenders being brought to justice if background possible deane had no choice but to
 sergeant hare took the stand in above press charges macleod and created a sensation not only did he report all
 the missing details superintendent r burton deane was the problem of lack of evidence was of the case but admitted
 that he had in charge of the investigation of the tar effectively solved by a surprising turn of taken part
 in the tarring and feathering and feather case events sergeant hare the mountie and was one of the leaders hare
 assigned to the town police station identified all the members of the turned queen s evidence on promise of gang
 henry howard david whitney immunity the onus of bringing the matthew goldsmith william case to trial was on deane and
 he thompson daniel mcintosh and alberta history i spring 1995 finally charles warren the accused as it was at this
 juncture that the case fell the leader warren had been asked to apart the two key witnesses for the captain
 the mob because he supposedly prosecution disappeared sergeant hare had had past experience in similar escaped to the united states
 matthew situations and because there was less goldsmith also slipped out the case chance of him being recognized as he
 was called but the witnesses did not the jury was out for two hours was from out of town the
 others in the appear the trial was finally postponed gang used false voices during the until the next court that
 winter and then returned to announced that incident but warren had not hence he warren was released on bail he
 was the only one who could be directly decided to take advantage of his there was no possibility that implicated
 in the act maxwell freedom and follow hare south so donaldson had identified warren by the when he failed to
 appear at his trial on they could agree on a verdict sound of his voice a conclusion now november 16
 th the case was dismissed confirmed by sergeant hare as for the the whole affair had undoubtedly other members of
 the gang two had left disgusted and frustrated deane from the country before the trial the others beginning to end
 he had been forced to testified and committed perjury acknowledge hare s disregard for his oath of office and had
 also been forced james donaldson was supposed to testify against his better judgement to bring in fact it was his
 promise to take the stand local heroes to trial against in macleod that had in part convinced overwhelming popular sentiment
 he deane to bring the case to trial in the first had managed to build a solid case place to
 deane s disappointment and against charles warren and felt that disgust however james alexander the result of the trial seemed
 to be a donaldson was cur enough to â€˜ wilt at the foregone conclusion 4 though deane last moment a
 nd dare not face the music could not have been very sur prised by in the witness box the outcome
 he was nevertheless disgusted it was a marvel how any testimony was concluded and the jury men having any respect
 for the oath began its deliberations they were out which they had taken â€˜ true verdict to for two hours
 then returned to give according to the evidence could announce that there was no possibility have failed to convict the
 prisoner 4 that they could agree on a verdict the however deane consoled himself when jury was disbanded and a
 new trial it was all over saying the prosecution called for july 10 th has had its effect and it
 is quite likely that there will be no further experiments here with lynch law 42 the tarring and feathering of
 james donaldson is an example of the least serious type of violent crime assault the crime was a one shot
 deal and did not undermine the law in any serious manner or lead to further uprisings one target james donaldson
 was specific as was the goal to run him out of town minor incidents such as this were fairly common
 in frontier towns thus the mounties accepted them as inevitable and tried whenever possible to act as arbiters 43 after
 all their main concern was to maintain peace and order and so alberta history i spring 199 s far as
