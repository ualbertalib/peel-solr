 p p c l i ever since the battle of the aisne 1914 the increasing strength of the defence and 
 the corresponding weakness of the attack has exercised the minds of all soldiers time and again in the great war 
 the infantry were stopped and suffered appalling casualties in the attack of a defensive position before they could get to 
 grips with the enemy the defenders usually had the choice of ground and the advantage of prepared positions which they 
 had reconnoitred with a view to counter attack or withdrawal they selected positions covered by natural obstacles and upon which 
 they could locate their machine guns so that these were almost immune from ordinary artillery fire visibility conferred upon the 
 defenders an inherent adaptability to meet surprise these conditions produced an impasse which gave most of the advantages to the 
 defenders and necessitated a disproportionate 0:disprop 0:ortionate loss in lives to the attackers despite the latter s claim to the 
 initiative towards the end of the war tanks solved the problem as far as the actual assault was concerned and 
 the enthusiasts claimed that these weapons had readjusted the balance between attack and defence but this early optimism has been 
 considerably modified tanks are very expensive and at the commencement of a campaign their numbers must of necessity be small 
 the replacement of tank casualties will present grave difficulties and further production will be delayed until the machinery of factories 
 has been adapted to turning them out in large numbers furthermore tanks are vulnerable when exposed to the fire of 
 hostile antitank 0:anti 0:tank guns or artillery the new 20 m m anti tank gun which can be fired either 
 from a bipod mounting or from a wheeled carriage may restrict tank movement as effectively as the movement of infantry 
 in close formations is paralysed today armour piercing bullets from rifles with a muzzle velocity until recently undreamed of open 
 up enormous possibilities when used in the hands of resolute infantry wheeled platforms for field guns and improved mines have 
 also increased the power of defence against tanks in 1914 each battalion of the british expeditionary force had two machine 
 guns on its establishment that is to say twentyfour 0:twenty 0:four machine guns on a divisional front with the experience 
 which we now have behind us i venture to say that machine guns were in the majority of cases wrongly 
 employed at the outbreak of the great war they were continually placed in exposed positions in forward trenches where they 
 were at once spotted and just as quickly blown out of existence by the opposing artillery 
 5 now we know a good deal about the employment of machine guns and it may be assumed that any 
 commander acting on the defensive will select positions from which his machine guns can employ enfilade rather than frontal fire 
 and will accept a second rate arc of fire for his guns provided he can conceal them in preference to 
 an exposed position even though it offers a much better field of fire surprise in defence is just as important 
 as surprise in the attack in an infantry battalion today at war establishment there are twelve vickers machine guns in 
 the support company and twenty four light automatics these are to all intents and purposes light machine guns making a 
 total of 432 machine guns on the frontage of a division as against the twenty four in 1914 the weakness 
 of the attack becomes more and more apparent as each training season progresses the problem reduced to its simplest terms 
 is how to knock out or neutralize the hidden machine gun various solutions have been advanced such as an increase 
 of artillery armoured fighting vehicles and a more flexible infantry the amount of artillery available within the division has increased 
 but little since the war and is still insufficient to cover with a barrage the front of more than one 
 battalion within the narrow limits covered by such a barrage the attack might probably succeed but the flanks of the 
 attackers would be exposed to the fire of machine guns that did not come within the area of the barrage 
 and success might be jeopardized by counter attacks against the sides of the narrow salient formed apart from the actual 
 number of guns available considerable improvements have been made in artillery weapons the range rates of fire the traverse and 
 mobility of field guns and howitzers have increased the difficulty of providing adequate covering fire quickly enough to meet the 
 problems of open warfare however remains it is important therefore that a commander should choose a line of advance for 
 his attack which will give the greatest scope for the available artillery within the time that he has at his 
 disposal with regards to the use of armoured fighting vehicles during the last war tanks were used in direct co 
 operation with infantry and while under certain circumstances this may still bo a role for tanks it is a method 
 of employment that will rarely be justified against a well equipped enemy direct co operation usually entails operations over the 
 least suitable ground for tank movement tanks dislike attacking up hills as gradients slow down their speed against the defenders 
 most highly developed anti tank organization and with but remote opportunities of effecting a surprise the method of employment most 
 favoured by many is that of a semi independent role against some rearward enemy objective or against the enemy s 
 flank where 
 6 the chances of surprise may be greater the ground more favourable and the enemy s anti tank organization less 
 complete under such circumstances the tank commander would have to reconnoitre the enemy with his own resources and must manoeuvre 
 so as to engage him covered by his own supporting fire to this end the tank brigade composed of light 
 medium and support tanks is formed in short the tanks are quite prepared to win the war but are not 
 particularly interested in helping the infantry to do so the third alternative namely that of increasing the mobility of the 
 infantry finds supporters in the advocates of the modern light infantryman who claim that modern war demands that the infantry 
 soldier should be possessed of the powers of the stalker the sharpshooter and the athlete these qualities should enable him 
 to become a highly skilled military shot an expert in the use of ground in every sense a field craftsman 
 active over rough and hilly country and capable of covering distances up to 1 000 yards at high speed during 
 the great war one frequently heard the expression loaded like a mule this simile is hardly fair to that intelligent 
 0:intell 0:igent beast for while the average army mule weighs 1 100 lbs his load seldom exceeds 250 lbs yet 
 the infantry soldier of say 140 lbs there v ere many men well below that figure during the war was 
 asked to carry 80 lbs when he went over the top if the intense activity energy and battlefield mobility of 
 the light infantryman are demanded then he must be clothed and equipped 0:equipp 0:ed suitably the experimental uniform of 1952 
 is a step in the right direction fire and movement even though combined with the most skilful use of ground 
 will never be sufficient in themselves to overcome organized machine gun defence dislocated though that be by the fire of 
 the artillery supporting the attackers the hidden machine gun that has escaped the covering fire remains to overcome 0:over 0:come 
 this there have recently been added to the support companies of infantry battalions four mortars these mortars are to be 
 used as the primary close support weapon and may i think be looked upon as offensive high trajectory machine guns 
 an infantry 0:inf 0:antry weapon pure and simple usually working under the command of a forward company designed for the 
 purpose either of knocking out with its h e shell the hidden machine gun or blinding it with smoke a 
 high trajectory weapon ia essential because the defender s machine guns will in all probability be dug in and under 
 such circumstances cannot be dislodged by any flat weapon if the impetus of the attack is not to be lost 
 the hidden machine gun once located must be dealt with quickly and effective considerable time may often elapse before the 
 exact location can be communicated to the supporting artillery meanwhile the forward infantry may have suffered heavy casualties and become 
 stabilised continued on page 22

 did it was awful to hear him somehow i believed him innocent i don t know why out i just 
 had that feeling poor devil i pitied him sitting alone in that cell with the shadow of the hangman s

 but they didn t want him to die at least not that way there was only one way to satisfy

 kinds of things including an early freedom the temptation we e tec great you sec i wanted to see my 
 wife and we 11 never mind about that oo they took me to the hospital i shall never forget tony

 been convicted of a particularly cruel and coldblc 0:cold 0:blc eded mur dor anyhow the operation was a success my

 so the strange adventures of euripides h k io e jf jj j j j sj no 2 murder at 
 h c euripides was bored frankly and unashamedly bored in fact so much so that he did not even bother 
 to brush a polite wing tip across a gaping beak to stifle an involuntary yawn and no wonder the dog 
 days had come once again and is not everyone depressed at this trying time of the year and furthermore the 
 universal seagulls were not up to scratch these days they simply had no spare energy the hours of sunshine palled 
 and the warm moonlit nights wore not conducive to peaceful slumber but to romance and nights devoted to venus and 
 perchance to bacchus are not conducive to sustained effort under the glaring eye of sol and the blast of aeolus 
 yes undoubtedly something had to bo done no longer were the rousing strains of glen whorple heard rising from the 
 busy banana peel fatigues in the harbour in fact fatigue parties could no longer be called busy the supply depot 
 was getting definitely low on peels and for nearly a month fresh fish had been unheard of any old barnacle 
 in a doldrum seemed to the slogan of the day interest that s what they lack mused euripides and human 
 interest for preference is there nothing wherewith wo can overcome this midsummer ennui with these thoughts revolving in his mind 
 he strolled out of h q crevice and gazed meditatively 0:meditative 0:ly down upon his rocky parade ground sloping away 
 in a heated haze to the water s edge i wonder ho those work point wallahs manage to maintain interest

 the spot whoro a cap button might have been umph ye os ah mr aleiabides there have been no somnolent 
 sounds from the direction of work point will you proceed there and report as to how their troops are kept 
 awake during such trying weather very good sirl cimo the reply in a smart and soldior lika manner as alciabidos 
 turned upon his heel end flow off in quick time his wings raised at each pace to the height of 
 the shoulder in precisely the manner laid down in seagull training vol i with amendments a truly military figure was 
 the adjutant 
 21 alciabidos had boon gone for a long time in fact tho minutes had dragged out into hours and finally 
 aftor having paced impatiently up and down in front of orderly room crevice for what seemed an eternity euripides took 
 to air and in an execrable humour winged his way towards barracks blankoty blankoty blank blank blank muttered the co 
 between the stoned of his crop what con be keeping my adj as he noarod work point rip could discern 
 no sign of alciabidco nor was there another soul in sight the place seemed entirely deserted but just then a 
 rotund figure in a scarlet sash rounded the corner by tho stables and made across the gravel depressing his ailerons 
 rip zoomed and addresses the figure where arc tho troops sgt major ho queried rodd hill and heel s came 
 the faint reply mo dam wonder murmured the little chap wo couldn t hoar thorn snoring from way out there

 gull s instant reaction must have a look sec 5 1 cutting out his motor rip descended to a noat 
 two point landing on the railing at the south entrance of the administration building hopping to the floor he strode 
 into the building and up to a door marked private with a delicate motion of one wing he scratched at 
 the door panel and entered before him was a large room with map hung walls and a handsome oak desk 
 on the desk towering to the ceiling were huge bundles of paper in wire cages labelled u r in out 
 signature etc box room thought the o c gulls yet stay there is a phone must be an occupant with 
 that the little fellow gave er the gun and flitted to the top of one gigantic pile settling gently he 
 teetered for a second on his toes then staggered back in horror eor there before his alarmed gaze completely hidden 
 by the stacks of files was the silent motionless figure of a staff officer swathed in funereal garb good lord 
 gasped euripides he s been made ready for the undertaker for the still form before him sat with bowed head 
 encircled in a long white cloth from the neck downward at that moment a step sounded without and through the 
 door came a tall sad faced soldier bearing a towel a wash basin and several weird looking instruments 
 22 the undertaker himself shuddered rip hopping nimbly to the other side of the files his fascinated gaze followed the 
 man with the towels as he approached the inanimate form and deposited his burden upon a table in rear a 
 long sharp instrument 0:instru 0:ment was produced and with short deft movements passed through an accumulation of foam over the 
 ears and down the neck of the victim the long sad faced one stepped back and whisking away the long 
 white cloth held out his hand that s all sir he said as the still form at the desk suddenly 
 came to life and grasped a pen two bits i ll sweep up the hair on the floor right away 
 i the hidden machine gun continued from page 6 to such an extent that it may prove difficult to get 
 the attack going again the mortar will undoubtedly increase to some extent the offensive power of the infantry battalion and 
 its main role will be to give quick and close support to forward rifle companies 0:compan 0:ies in conclusion it 
 would seen that the power of the machine gun in the defence cannot be exaggerated it may be said that 
 the main problem of modern warfare is how to launch and sustain an offensive against an enemy armed with these 
 weapons if they are protected by barbed wire the problem becomes considerably more difficult the hidden machine gun still reigns

 23 mm m ys august 12th 15th 19lg on august gth the black day of the german amy according to 
 ludondorff ms launched at amiens the attack which marked the opening of the hundred days „ complete surprise was the 
 essential element of this great drive and it had borne great resultso nothing went wrong the wildest hopes were realized 
 the cavalry went trhough the trenches seemed te be left forever behind while the tale of prisoners the captures of 
 guns and supplies and the number of relieved villages were all prodigous general ludendorff however quickly took the crisis in 
 hand and was able to stop the riot more rapidly than had seemed possible 0:possi 0:ble to the allied command 
 picked troops including the famous alpine corps were rushed up and hurled into the counter attack and between august 9th 
 and l j ith nine fresh divisions were pitted against the canadian corps alone on the morning of august 12th 
 913 the patricia s found themselves holding the old allied front line trenches of everywhere decayed and much overgrown between 
 the roads that converge upon parvillers from rouvroy to the north and lequesnoy on the south in front of the 
 regiment lay the old no man s land and the german trench line running from foj quescourt west to to 
 amiens rove road not one trench indeed but three and these agains supported by many strong points in the villages 
 behind these powerful defences had been penetrated at two places and in the afternoon of the 12th another attempt was 
 set on foot the plan involved an attack by the 2 4 2 nd battalion from fouquescourt 0:fouques 0:court towards 
 the northwest entrance of parvillers and an assault by ether units of the 9th brigade in front of dameey although 
 the patricia s had no orders to participate in this action col stewart seized the favourable opportunity of aiding the 
 assault of the battalion through the co operation of the officer commanding the ll6th battalion no 3 company patricia s 
 capt e mj macßrayne was able to advance to a favourable position from which to launch a strong raid against 
 the enemy forces on our front 
 24 after a prolonged reconnaissance capt macßrayne launched his attack on the left flank stiff resistance was encountered for the 
 germans were numerous and well provided with machine guns e on the right however capt 0 macßrayne with a bombing 
 section of eight men attacked down the trenches with great success and after an advance of nearly 700 yards established 
 a position that threatened parvillers from the south a striking local success had been gained but in it s new 
 posts the company soon fouiad itself dangerously isolated in the early hours of the 13th a violent counter attack drcva 
 the ll6th battalion on our right out cnee more to trenches kqo yards back and half an hour later the 
 enemy struck at capt kaoßrayne s detachment our whole right flank was now completely isolated and at five a r 
 m the germans approximately a battalion strong emerged from the woods in close formation and attacked no 3 company from 
 the direction ox both parvillerb and damery the patricia s were not only outnumbered but menaced from three aides and 
 capt mae3rayne reluctantly gave the order to fall back in his desperate retreating action against overwhelming force the next hour 
 saw one of the most gallant episodes in the regiment s history two platoons were cut off and their only 
 choice was to fight their way through or surrender c the conduct of these men was a wonderful example to 
 their comrades lieut j c fuller when his platoon was counterattacked 0:counter 0:attacked on both flanks and from the rear 
 covered the retirement and with three other ranks fought off the enemy until all his wounded had been cleared from 
 the trench he saved his platoon and was the last man to withdraw from the enemy position most conspicuous gallantry 
 of all was that of sgt robert spall he took a lev is gun and standing on the parapet fired 
 upon the advancing enemy inflicting most severe casualties he then came clown the trench 6 meeting the men into a 
 sap 75 yards from the enemy picking up another lewis gun he again climbed the parapet and with his fire 
 held up the enemy here he deliberately 0:delib 0:erately gave his life in order to extricate his platoon from a 
 most difficult situation col stewart recommended sgt spall for the highest of all honours and his next of kin received 
 the last victoria cross won by the regiment the company extricated itself and with the ll6th battalion made a stand 
 in the old german line the losses were amazingly small for such hard fighting as it had seemed in the 
 last 12 hours lieut d a wright and three men were killed while 12 n c os and men were 
 wounded an officer other prisoners and no less than 26 machine guns captured are to be placed against the losses 
 veryr heavy damage had been inflicted on the enemy during the advance and still heavier in the retreat the killed 
 alone must have numbered 150 fighting continued intermittently on this flank all day and the canadian position was to some 
 extent bettered by evening

 was indulged in at heal s camp this year as usual the first thing in camp to go up on 
 our arrival there was the volley ball net and it has boon kept busy ever since from out uhe dim

 standards of extremely uncertain age and even more uncertain stability yet their usefulness is undoubted for after having served faithfully 
 from dismiss until dark for two months without a break they have tenderly been tucked away from prying eyes and 
 molesting hands to await another season it is quite fascinating to watch the keener sports hurry off parade play threeor 
 four games of volley ball eat supper and dash off a couple of dozen tosses at the basket just to 
 keep themselves in trim for the baseball game at 6 30 after which the opposing baseballers again set themselves up 
 as volleyball artists size of teams being a minor point and frantically fight off boredom until the darkness drives them

 a ia hollo bill good bye billi that s how quickly saturday noon rubbed shoulders with monday noon this woek 
 at maple bay camp the best and most enjoyable camp yet that epitomizes the opinion of those who took part 
 in this all too brief visit to maple bay this year browsing for a while on points after camping it 
 occurs that possibly one or two points may be worth mentioning firstly it was apparent that members of units having 
 been cramped up all winter and spring felt strange at being called upon to do in their new surroundings what 
 they had so often done around tho sand table to break up this feeling of strangeness it is suggested that 
 just prior to going to camp one sunday in vancouver be devoted to a brigade or a battalion scheme out 
 in the open to save transportation expenses the little mountain area could be used secondly that units hold their annual 
 inspection earlier in the season in order that more time could then he devoted to field training using as the 
 n p a m do the same complete text books as the british regular army and the permanent force the 
 need for a small militarry compendium was apparent a few mimeographed sheets let us say containing the gist of tho 
 most important parts of tho subjects dealt with i e extracts from pages so and 81 infantry section leading 1934 
 a few notes on fun control orders etc in the field quick recourse could then be had to these notes 
 instead of leafing hurriedly in what sometimes proves to be a vain attempt to find what is required not tho 
 least pleasing feature of tho annual hogira to vancouver island is tho fact that it brings us in touch once 
 again with our friends of the navy good follows all and moot hoepitablc all units of the 23rd infantry brigade

 our parade state shows tho strength to be 58 all ranks 1 horse 4 feet 1 ford v 8 this 
 does not count because the tires 6 in number are rubber our statistical expert has figured out that not counting 
 side trips to points of special interest each man will take 171 178 paces on the march from comox to 
 victoria or an average of 8 730 078 paces per company is this what is called putting them through their
