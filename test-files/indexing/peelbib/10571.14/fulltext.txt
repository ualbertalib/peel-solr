 grenade throwing one draft of 43 men has been formed to date and by now personnel are either arriving in 
 korea or are already serving in the front line the preparing of drafts for korea requires patience and a mammoth 
 machine of human beings for documentation the task includes the processing of medical documents mfm 6 s itr s identity 
 cards dog tags leave forms and transportation 0:trans 0:portation warrants those who have been wondering at the cause of the 
 never ending line of soldiers outside the company office are informed that this line is composed of individuals who for 
 sundry reasons were taken off the draft and are making a bid through the company commander to be replaced on 
 the draft support company highlights by cpl b j maitre december was indeed a happy month which allowed many wishes

 being attended by company personnel at the school of infantry in camp borden hq company by pte rosen it is 
 barely three months since headquarters company was formed on our return home from the far east we must make comment

 to congratulate staff shaw on his posting as cqms of hq company without that red moustache he is found to 
 be most acceptable comment heard in the stop and go inn if the meals get any worse and prices any 
 higher in this joint a guy will soon have to eat in the mess it was hinted that l cpl 
 norman and l cpl thurn have requested transfer to the provost corps both are experienced with some of the aspects 
 of provost life we are glad to see that csm wo2 roberts has returned from charley company where he was 
 on loan along with his pipe naturally it must be very uncomfortable sleeping with a pipe in the mouth congratulations

 days cb since our return home the company has lost that esteemed drum major jock mackie alias roily polly he 
 is now employed as cqms with d coy and is sorely missed by the whole company never the less we

 for the rq s secretary too battalion hq notes since our return from korea there have been numerous changes of 
 personnel in battalion headquarters 0:head 0:quarters some of the new faces and appointments 0:appoint 0:ments are as follows major co 
 huggard 2ic capt g a gunton adjt lt r j frost asst adjt and sgt g w elliott sgt thomas 
 is rapidly catching up the work in the bor and it should not be long before a high degree of 
 efficiency is reached while we mention sgt thomas it is wondered if he was as exuberant in making his good 
 year wishes this year as he was in january parachute training wing 1 battalion having returned from a year s 
 service 0:ser 0:vice in korea prepared to assume its new role as a part of canada s mobile striking force 
 in order to function effectively as a parachute battalion 0:bat 0:talion several problems had to be solved 
 the patrician 11 parachutists who had served with the unit in korea had not jumped for eighteen months and were 
 out of form new jump techniques equipment 0:equip 0:ment and aircraft had replaced those with which the unit was familiar 
 to deal with these problems a parachute training wing was formed consisting of a co ordinating officer major mainprize lieutenant 
 caesar and 10 non commissioned officers 0:offi 0:cers the function of the parachute training wing is to conduct pre parachute 
 training for all dersonnel 0:der 0:sonnel proceeding to cjatc for parachute training 0:train 0:ing the object of this training is 
 to prepare the soldier mentally and physically for parachute training a seven day course deals briefly with jump techniques and 
 equipment culminating in exits from the mock tower this indoctrination 0:indoctrina 0:tion has definitely proved to be effective and has 
 resulted in only one psychological failure out of 206 officers and men despatched to canadian joint air training centre in 
 addition a refresher and reconversion program 0:pro 0:gram is carried out for all unit personnel the object of this training 
 is 1 to improve the individual s 0:indi 0:vidual 0:s jump technique 2 to train the individual 0:individ 0:ual in 
 the use of new equipment and 3 to initiate 0:initi 0:ate the individual in the jump procedures of the c

 role of an enemy force superior in strength and equipment of all types the unit exercised 25 cibrg consisting of

 recruit training had increased to such an extent that at this period there were 10 platoons of men undergoing basic 
 and advance training it can be readily appreciated that this coupled with the strenuous airborne activity imposed quite a strain 
 on the resources of the unit in the period 1 april 52 to 31 march 53 700 recruits were trained 
 throughout the week commencing 17 november 0:nov 0:ember the airborne troops in the unit underwent 0:under 0:went conversion training from

 who found themselves on 5 january 0:jan 0:uary 53 in sarcee on exercise hot dog this was one of two 
 preparatory exercises designed to ready the troops for exercise bulldog later in the winter until the end of the month 
 the troops were practiced in winter indoctrination and standard operating procedure in reducing enemy lodgements during this period experiments 0:experi 
 0:ments were also carried out on different types of rations from the standard five in one pack to a type 
 of pemmican designed by lt col stone the second exercise bullship followed immediately 0:im 0:mediately from the 2 6 feb 
 when the msf was dropped in the vicinity of dog pound near cochrane and put into practice the lessons learned 
 in sarcee after a short leave the msf boarded their busses to fort nelson where they emplaned on 15 feb 
 for their drop into norman wells the war was postponed for half an hour however when pte bodner s rifle 
 valise became entangled in the aircraft he spent some 35 minutes suspended 0:sus 0:pended under the fusilage in the 32 
 degree below 0:be 0:low zero weather several unsuccessful attempts were made to pull him back into the aircraft and he 
 was finally cut loose at 2000 feet and landed completly unharmed in recognition of his steadfast courage he was recently 
 awarded a certificate of commendation by the cgs this exercise culminated the units airborne tests and was the last in 
 which the unit participated it was gratifying to note that in recognition of their proficiency the exercise was ended ahead 
 of schedule and the unit returned on the 25 feb from the field some of the problems of the unit 
 can be appreciated when it is pointed out that during this period the unit strength was roughly 1500 in addition 
 to the heavy airborne activity an extremely heavy course schedule held the unit about 50 understrength in officers and ncos 
 to a very gruelling pace as well as training hundreds of recruits 570 personnel were dispatched 0:dis 0:patched on courses 
 ranging from parachuting to cooking from apr 52 to 31 mar 53 the visit on 17 feb of brig f

 their honour the airborne role of the unit was taken over by the ist battalion on the 1 april 53 
 they had spent the preceding months after their return 0:re 0:turn from the far east brushing up on airborne technique 
 and training new jumpers 1 battalion also assumed the responsibility for training of recruits and dispatching of reinforcements 0:reinforce 0:ments 
 to the orient this has left the second free to concentrate on training for its next overseas 0:over 0:seas tour 
 back to sarcee camp early in may the unit is now undergoing intensive training designed to make it the best 
 canadian unit in the european theatre morale is high in spite of very adverse weather 0:weath 0:er conditions and the 
 proof that our aim is being attained was embodied in the remarks of the goc western command on his inspection 
 on 27 may 53 after taking the salute on the march past of the battalion on an impromptu parade square 
 ank e deep in mud maj gen yokes stated that he had never seen a better parade under worse conditions 
 on entering this third phase of our battalion s short history we welcome the opportunity to add yet another chapter 
 of achievement all ranks are determined that these achievements will be worthy of the traditions of the regiment of which 
 we are so proud to all patricias past and present the second sends greetings and best wishes for continuing success

 11 a group of enterprising patricias met in montreal 0:mon 0:treal to discuss the possibility of reviving 0:re 0:viving interest 
 in the ppcli association 0:associ 0:ation which due to circumstances beyond 0:be 0:yond anyone s control had become inactive 0:in 
 0:active in the east although the meeting was held primarily to revive interest in the montreal 0:mon 0:treal branch of 
 the association brigadier 0:bri 0:gadier gault lieutenant colonel cobbett 0:cob 0:bett major gammell along with major 0:ma 0:jor colin mcdougall 
 and several others thought some action should be taken in an effort to bring about a more intimate 0:in 0:timate 
 liaison between all the patricia clubs in canada many of which had been very active in their functions since originally 
 organized after world war i the montreal meeting held early in 1946 was attended by many ex patricias from both 
 wars and from this emerged a rejuvenated montreal branch which has been holding at least two well attended gatherings a 
 year ever since their present nominal roll totals approximately 125 and it is hoped this will grow each year as 
 new patricias are enrolled from montreal and the surrounding areas the mention of a closer liaison between 0:be 0:tween branches 
 was equivalent to a new call to arms for brigadier gault who immediately swung into action at the annual meeting 
 of the association following the regimental trooping of the colours in may of 1946 at that meeting brigadier gault proposed 
 0:pro 0:posed an honorary central regimental 0:regiment 0:al executive committee to be organized 0:organiz 0:ed for this purpose while he 
 had hoped 0:hop 0:ed it would be possible to have this committee function from regimental headquarters it was found to 
 be impossible 0:im 0:possible due entirely to rapid turnover in personnel preparations for paratroop 0:para 0:troop training and movement of 
 potential 0:po 0:tential central executive members to various parts of canada on a moment s notice brigadier gault was then 
 asked if he could form a temporary committee to function out of montreal and operate under his guidance approximately three 
 months later this was done with a committee composed of the following 0:follow 0:ing 
 the patrician 21 honorary chairman brigadier a h gault dso ed honorary treasurer 0:treas 0:urer lt col s a cobbett 
 honorary secretary lt c f dumaresq honorary member major r g m gammell honorary member major c m mc dougall 
 dso this temporary committee is still functioning and will continue until such time as its activities can be transferred 0:trans 
 0:ferred permanently to regimental headquarters where it can work in much closer liaison with the regiment itself since its formation 
 the temporary committee has collected approximately 530 00 in cash for comforts for the first second and third battalions in 
 korea in addition it has been successful 0:success 0:ful in procuring many free gifts of playing cards from the various 
 clubs in montreal together with innumerable 0:innumer 0:able paperbacked books and magazines 0:maga 0:zines all of which were donated by

 it has been the practice to submit each portion of this tale to the onslaught of criticism of persons concerned 
 where possible those lessons 0:les 0:sons that are more instructive are therefore detailed 0:de 0:tailed those war stories from which

 complement of vehicles weapons company stores and winter clothing a short suspension of training 0:train 0:ing and administration was observed 
 on christmas 0:christ 0:mas day to allow the troops to celebrate and enjoy the excellent yuletide feast supplied by the
