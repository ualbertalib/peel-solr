 nov 54 1 mar 55 can best be summed up by members of first battalion in the story of the 
 two buzzards who were circling sarcee when a modern jet flew by at 550 m p h the young buzzard 
 said gosh he s really in a hurry the older buzzard 0:buz 0:zard replied son you d be in a 
 heck of a hurry too if your tail was on fire during november the unit commenced 0:com 0:menced arctic training 
 in anticipation of a sojourn to an unmentioned portion of hudson s bay the weather remained 0:remain 0:ed beautiful the 
 rsm took an anticipatory 0:anticipa 0:tory trip to the arctic and mike the mascot made friends with the qsmi s 
 cocker spaniel the co and a number of officers and nco s also went to the arctic where they umpired 
 a famous regiment from london ontario through exercise bulldog ii with a great fanfare of press releases arctic training continued 
 in sarcee the arctic novices seriously began to doubt the buddy system of preventing frost bite because most of them 
 were nearer to heat exhaustion christmas approached the christmas dinner for all ranks was held at noon on 23 dec 
 54 to permit 0:per 0:mit the maximum attendance and still not interfere with leave the patricia depot joined with first 
 battalion for this occasion and the cpls and ptes enjoyed the usual custom of individual table service by the officers 
 wo s and senior nco s rumour has it that the civilian messmen did not report the incident to their 
 union because it was believed apparent that none of these enthusiastic waiters knew how to keep their thumbs out of 
 the soup appropriate greetings and messages were read by the co lt col j r 
 the patrician 9 cameron obe and col d menard dso garrison commander new years was welcomed by the traditional ball

 of a television set in the common room of the men s quarters has been followed by the addition of 
 coffee and soft drink machines the arrangement is popular with everyone except the fatigueman next day and the canteen sergeant

 normally evidenced for later games at the corral transportation is being provided curling in the garrison league was popular and 
 accounted for a number of missing persons on wednesday and friday afternoons training appeared likely to interrupt the schedule on

 patricias welcomed many other maroon bereted elements including old friends from ontario and manitoba and the group prepared the complicated 
 administrative 0:administra 0:tive effort required for exercise mike the mascot mike refused to partic pate but the majority of the 
 battalio i weren t given that privilege the weather stayed above zero because everyone involved was arctic traine i and 
 equipped this large exercise was marred by the accidental death of pte d l mason of signals platoon the i 
 heartfelt sympathy of his comrades went out to mrs mason from the colonel 0:col 0:onel down to the newest parachutist 
 by the last week of february most of the unit left calgary to participate in exercise bulldog 111 to prove 
 that the dictates of higher headquarters are infallible the weatherman was ordered 0:order 0:ed to get in the act so

 wasn t careful checking the parachutists properly earned most appreciated compliments from the goc many other members of the unit 
 and our associates of the royal canadian air force contributed very largely to the teamwork that made possible a good 
 show the unit returned to calgary in surprisingly short time and morale was high even the sobering sight of cash 
 debit vouchers 0:vou 0:chers for losses has been surmounted with only the normal tears our airborne 0:air 0:borne associates of 
 other corps departed 0:depart 0:ed homeward with the thanks and best wishes of the battalion the unit breathed a sigh 
 of relief that bulldog 111 was over only to discover that a complete re organization was required to prepare for

 board that the army is trying to shanghai graduating high school students for service with the colours such is not 
 the case but if it were is a military career that repugnant it is unfortunate that a member of the 
 forces in canada cannot enjoy the prestige and honor which is bestowed on british servicemen by the people of the 
 u k too many in the dominion feel that the service is only for the desolate offers nothing is comprised 
 of misfits and the poor sods who could not adjust to the normal demands of society others fail to see 
 that a call of patriotism is not necessarily being militaristic or a warmonger and that an individual s desire to 
 soldier can be every bit as strong as his call to the medical or clerical profession not only does the 
 army offer a wage a job a decent standard of living 0:liv 0:ing but also a proud profession not only 
 does it offer security but also a satisfying life with definite and obtainable 0:obtain 0:able goals the corporalcy the sergeantcy

 be about a baton being in every soldier s knapsack 0:knap 0:sack it is a tangible goal providing a constant 
 incentive to the soldier the industrial psychologist will amplify that purposeful activity is important to job satisfaction so many jobs

 in war have been as prominent 0:pro 0:minent in peace at the depot we see them all they come from

 military ways are accepted and become an integrated part of their personalities and their motivation to become a good soldier

 munro it is our pleasant task to report to you about the regimental birthday activities conducted at camp borden enclosed 
 you will find a nominal roll of patricians 0:patric 0:ians who participated in the broomball game we were very pleased 
 with the entire day the broomball was as usual a groaning success incidentally 0:in 0:cidentally won by the privates team 
 after the games we enjoyed a few sociable sips at the men s canteen in that crowded smoke filled palace 
 0:pal 0:ace we refought the battles in the regiment s history from sicily to korea we are pleased to note 
 that the regiment was even more glorious in action during these campaigns than we had previously been led to believe 
 the facts were amply substantiated by loud assertions such as yur damn right sur i wuz there and i seen 
 it happen at the canteen hideaway we also settled most of the major political issues of the day decided who 
 was and was not a good fellow 0:fel 0:low and many other incidentals that cropped up there was a buffet 
 dinner at 1830 which was preceeded by cocktails in more genteel surroundings 0:surround 0:ings the punch may have been differently 
 named but moose milk by any other name would taste as sweet the luncheon was served as a buffet style 
 and was well prepared and attractively laid out we were pleased to see brigadier d c cameron and col wilson 
 smith at our dinner the birthday cake bore a large crest and was trimmed in the regimental colours col wilson 
 smith cut the cake prior to the toasts to her majesty 0:ma 0:jesty and lady patricia following the luncheon we 
 had an informal sing song our male chorus certainly gave it the old college try the spirit indeed was willing 
 but the games and other activities rendered the flesh rather susceptible to fatigue and the participants 0:par 0:ticipants gradually eased 
 into the night we were very pleased with the conduct the co operative atlitude and general good feeling displayed by

 by colonel willoughby verner part 1 1800 809 published in 1912 gives the following account of the formation of the 
 regi hent the regiment now known as the rifle brigade was raised in 1800 and first made its name as 
 the rifle corps under lord nelson in the following year at the battle of copenhagen in 1803 it was numbered 
 the 95th and subsequently fought throughout the peninsular war and at waterloo as the 95th or the rifle regiment 0:regi 
 0:ment it was not until after waterloo that it was taken out of the numbered regiments 0:regi 0:ments of the 
 line and styled the rifle brigade colonel coote manningham founder of the rifle corps made representation to the military authorities 
 pointing out the importance of having a regiment in the british army furnished with a rifled arm and trained in 
 the special duties of riflemen 0:rifle 0:men in consequence of the suggestions made a circular letter was issued to the 
 commanding officers of fourteen regiments of the line requesting each to provide a detachment of 2 sergeants 2 corporals and 
 30 private men for instruction in the use of the rifle one captain one lieutenant and one ensign who volunteered 
 to serve in the corps of riflemen were to be recommended by each regiment the various detachments assembled at horsham 
 during the month of march 
 the patrician 25 1 800 the first parade of the experimental corps at horsham was held on 1 april 1800 
 by the end of the year 1800 the rifle corps numbered 435 ncos and men and thenceforward it grew steadily 
 the first gazette relating to the officers of the rifle corps is the london gazette 0:ga 0:zette of 18 october 
 1800 everyone of the officers formally gazetted had served in the original experimental corps of riflemen colonel coote manningham the 
 founder of the rifle corps was the first colonel 0:col 0:onel he died 26 august 1 809 with the rank 
 of major general from effects of the coruna campaign the selection of lieutenant colonel the honourable william stewart from the 
 67th foot as the first commanding officer had much to do with the unqualified success 0:suc 0:cess achieved in the 
 raising of the rifle corps the standing orders of the regiment though issued of course in colonel manningham s 0:man 
 0:ningham 0:s name were probably entirely compiled by stewart testify not only o his capability for organization and discipline but 
 in a most remarkable way to his detachment and advance on the military ideas of his time the germs if 
 not indeed the actual scheme of most of the late improvements for the training and advantage of the soldier are 
 found in these orders many plans carried out in the british army only after the middle of the nineteenth century 
 were included in the original standing orders and were adopted in the regiment from its formation a lieutenant in the 
 ritle corps 2b december 1800 in his letters to his family bears high testimony to stewart s ability in organizing 
 the corps stewart makes it a rule to strike at the heads with him the field officers must first be 
 steady and then he goes downwards hence the privates say we had better look sharp if he is so strict 
 with the officers another interesting excerpt from the early history of the regiment reads as follows the rifle selected for 
 the first british regiment thus armed was known after its maker s name as the baker rifle it was 2 
 ft 6 in in length seven grooved rifled one quarter turn and threw a ball of 20 to the pound 
 it was flint lock and weighed 9 2 lbs to this rifle a triangular bayonet 17 in long was fixed 
 by a spring the rifle was sighted for 100 yards with a folding sight for 200 yards but it could 
 be used with effect up to 300 yards the accuracy of this weapon is proved by baker having in his 
 experiments struck a diagram of a human figure at 100 yards range 32 times out of 34 shots and at 
 200 yards 22 out of 24 the rifle was loaded with some difficulty and at first wooden mallets were issued 
 to drive home the ball the riflemen carried a horn of powder slung over the shoulder the balls being carried 
 loose in the stock of the rifle was a brass box in which were stored the greased rags or patches 
 in which each ball wat wrapped before ramming it home a picker to clear the touch hole and a brush 
 both suspended by br iss chains to the waist belt were also carried such was the arm which was to 
 become world famous as the weapon of the rifles from copenhagen to waterloo the baker rifle was issued to various 
 other corps besides the 95th rifles from 1805 onward and continued 0:con 0:tinued to be the only rifle in use 
 in the british army until 1838 when it was supplanted by the brunswick rifle the home station of the rifle 
 brigade is located at winchester ancient royal capital of england the green jackets depot occupies the upper portion of this 
 historic and archaic barracks the regiment served in canada and was in garrison at fort henry the citadel of upper

 down verbatim and are not responsible for iny errors which may appear early in 1915 the late major general then 
 lieutenant colonel w a gries ach 0:gries 0:ach founded the 49th battalion the cap badge designed by him and issued 
 to the unit prior to moving overleas 0:over 0:leas consisted of a maple leaf in bronze with the figures 49 
 superimposed and unmounted by an imperial crown the words edmonton overseas battalion canada 0:can 0:ada was included with a small

 edmonon 0:edmon 0:on it was immediately reorganized as a unit of the n p a m and redesignated 49th battalion 
 the edmonton regiment it was constituted to perpetuate in addition 0:ad 0:dition the 51st and 66th battalions these units supplied 
 many re inforcement rafts to the 49th during the course of the war shortly after the formation of the n 
 p a m unit a new cap badge was authorized 0:auth 0:orized this badge was designed as follows a four 
 vaned flanders windmill unmounted by a crown in the centre of the vanes a coyote head to the right and 
 eft of the bottom vanes a maple leaf between the bottom vanes the figures 49 bie words canada appear under 
 the crown and edmonton regiment on a scroll at the bottom of the badge in this badge the two maple

 the patrician 27 an official document of the edmonton regiment which the writer has seen gives the date of this 
 badge as after the last war i e during 1919 or later a facsimile of this badge was presented to 
 ppcli by major general griesbach in 1917 and can now be seen in the museum in the twenties h m 
 king george v approved an alliance between the lo al regiment north lancashire and the edmonton regiment at about the 
 same time it was decided to again change the design of the cap badge the new design de i leted 
 the figures 49 from between the bottom vanes of the windmill and inserted 0:insert 0:ed instead a third maple leaf 
 the reason given for this change was that the three battalions perpetuated by the n p a m unit 49th 
 51st and 66th should alll have equal representation on the cap badge a maple leaf for each the coyote head 
 in this design is slightly larger the remaining features of the badge are the same as in the previous design 
 at the outbreak of world war ii 49th battalion the edmonton regiment was mobilized as a unit of 1 canadian 
 infantry division and re designated the 49th edmonton regiment after the move overseas a decision was made to incorporate 0:in 
 0:corporate a visible feature of the alliance with the loyal regiment into the cap badge and it was the unanimous 
 wish of all ranks to reinstate the figures 49 a new design was therefore made and submitted for approval beneath 
 the crown a loyal rose the figures 49 between the bottom vanes a maple leaf to the right and left 
 of the bottom vanes the coyote head is further enlarged the word canada is deleted the scroll beneath reads the 
 loyal edmonton 0:ed 0:monton regiment the extremities of the scroll curve inwards instead of outwards as in previous designs a 
 facsimile of this badge appears in this issue of the patrician 0:patric 0:ian it has been found impossible for the 
 present to accurately date the issue of this badge several conflicting opinions have been given from information we have been 
 able to gather partial issue had been made prior to the return to canada 0:can 0:ada in 1945 an official 
 document published in europe in august 1945 is stamped with the previous badge three maple leafs without the rose or

 gallant service in korea let us read what mr john fisher of the cbc says about calgary most albertans have 
 heard about the mounties historic trek across the unsettled prairies in their nind s eye they can see the long 
 winding line of redcoats with horses and prairie schooners a brave aravan threading its way across the prairies and along 
 ancient buffalo trails while redskins watch apprehensively 0:appre 0:hensively from a distance and report the progress of these strangers into 
 their country i the founding of fort macleod is a part of alberta history everyone should know and many can 
 icture the still weary troop e of the brave north west mounted police travelling still further through lis uncharted country 
 to start another fort at the junction of the bow and elbow rivers there began another important chapter in alberta 
 s history book called calgary although there are various stories as to the origination of calgary s name it s 
 claimed to have been named calgary by colonel macleod the scotch name for clear running water at least that s 
 what assistant commissioner ft g irvine stated in a letter of 1876 to the deputy minister of justice in ottawa 
 the coming of the north west mounted meant a fort the building of which was taken over by d w 
 davis the man in charge of the i g baker men the first building was made of dry pine logs 
 fourteen feet long lumber for the doors and flooring was cut with a whip saw by halfbreeds and when the 
 flurry of building died there stood calgary s fort a number of buildings surrounded by a log stockade about ten 
 feet high these men also put up a substantial store and some houses and before long the doors of calgary 
 s first trading post opened for business stocked with an assortment of goods brought from fort benton shortly after this 
 the hudson s bay company arrived built a small log building and also opened for business as the story of 
 the opening up of the west and legends of its wealth and abundance trickled back east more and more settlers 
 gathered their worldly belongings together bundled their families up and headed for the wide open spaces slowly and gradually they 
 sifted into calgary settling close to the fort for protection it was during this slow development of calgary from fort 
 to town that two of calgary s best known oldtimers doctors n j lindsay and r g brett arrived in 
 calgary by train it had taken them dyer a week to come from winnipeg through the flat monotony of the 
 prairies until the bow river was first sighted with purple haze of jagged mountains shadowed beyond and their first sight 
 of calgary in 1883 showed them nothing more than a small group of tents upon arriving at the end of 
 the railroad line where it stopped at the elbow river the two men noted that it really was a town 
 under canvas except 0:ex 0:cept for a few log buildings scattered here and there even the royal hotel was in 
 a striped tent under the management of one mr moulton but those were really the good old days for under 
 that canvas roof they got a delicious meal for fifty cents after stepping off the train doctor lindsay and doctor 
 brett crossed the elbow river on a log that was held taut in place by ropes from both banks in 
 those early days the indians still clung to their old lives and customs dr lindsay had heard a great deal 
 about these customs including the sun dance ceremonies and on learning they were in progress on the sarcee indian reserve 
 set out with dr brett to see for themselves at the sun dance house on the reserve torn toms were 
 thumping out their monotonous throb braves were dancing themselves into exhaustion and they were in the process of making a 
 brave two skewers attached to both ends of a rope passed around a pole had been pushed and shoved through 
 both sides of a young brave s chest he was leaning backwards on the rope pulling with all his weight 
 trying to 
 the patrician 29 the city of calgary 1955 looking south across the bow river photo by calgary herald tear the 
 skewers through his chest muscles to prove that he was strong enough to become a real brave the doctors watched 
 this barbaric spectacle for as long as they could stand it then moved towards the door but were detained until 
 they gave chief bull s head all the silver they had in those early days it was something indeed to 
 see the royal mail pulling out of calgary there they would stand in front of the i g baker store 
 ox teams of ten yoke each pulling three heavy lumber wagons the driver of the teams would be mounted on 
 a pony which he guided with his heels while in both hands he carried a huge whip which he cracked 
 and whirled energetically and loudly for ten to fifteen minutes he would ride up and down beside the hitched oxen 
 cracking the whip and yelling for all he was worth while the oxen stood placidly by gradually one would move 
 a bit then the other until slowly the three wagons would move creakily out of calgary on their way with 
 the royal mail in those early days there was a lot of unrest amongst the indians once dr lindsay was 
 called to the blackfoot reserve by indian agent brown who asked him to come quietly and conduct a secret post 
 
 the patrician 30 inortem on an indian believed shot by a white man so they the indian agent an interpreter 
 and dr lindsay set out from the indian reserve in a direction opposite to the one where the body was 
 lying then gradually swung in the right direction and found the body wrapped in canvas and buffalo robes ind lying 
 in a coffin of logs placed three feet above the ground dr lindsay set to work on his post mortem 
 at once and was halfway through when suddently glancing 0:glanc 0:ing behind him he started at the sight of around 
 two hundred indians in warpaint and feathers with lawed off rifles and their brightly painted horses he hadn t heard 
 them come up at all and turning to brown asked what s going on i go ahead with your work 
 and see that you find the bullet was the agent s terse rejoinder dr indsay found the bullet and handed 
 it to the interpreter who held it up with a sigh of relief and mutterd 0:mutter 0:d a charmed bullet 
 i the doctor continued with his work while the bullet was passed to the indian chief when he lookd 0:look 
 0:d up again the indians and their horses had disappeared as soundlessly and suddenly as they had come hen he 
 discovered that luckily for him the bullet was one used by the indians if the brave had been illed by 
 a white man dr lindsay would probably have met his death then and there in retaliation that was calgary as 
 the oldtimers like doctor lindsay knew it a town under canvas with sections lot streets a cowboy s town with 
 true western hospitality and unpredictable indians on the outskirts he settlers and new calgarians were busy building homes and businesses 
 meeting the newcomers and bnaking them feel at home putting ranchers too late to catch the hotel up for the 
 night yes they were bar too busy building a future and helping their neighbors to grow grey hairs over the 
 thought of some ne 0:some 0:ne stealing the new family treasures they d managed to bring west with them so 
 their doors were al ays 0:al 0:ays open strangers were always welcome and they all lived and worked helping each 
 other from these formative days of the west grew such outstanding men as bob edwards editor of the amous or 
 infamous eye opener r b bennett the man who won an election in 1930 from w l m king lenry 
 wise wood the man from missouri who took root in calgary and fathered the alberta wheat pool early calgary had 
 something to do with the development of paddy nolan one of the west s greatest lawyers bill aberhardt the former 
 high school teacher who got the social credit movement really in 1935 and the fabulous irishman pat burns as well 
 as dozens of other well known canadians hind albertans right now there are around 165 000 people in calgary but 
 the city planning department estimates hhat by 1981 there will be over 230 000 calgary also has an amazing number 
 of cars there is one car tor every 3 9 persons a figure that only los angeles can beat so 
 far as the north american continent roes it s estimated that in thirty years there ll be 2 1 persons 
 per car i any way you look at it calgary has really grown since those early days of a town 
 under canvas bk ne of the things which has helped promote it is the famous calgary stampede held the second 
 week fef july or those chinooks that breathe across the foothills and suddenly turn the coldest day warm without warning 
 then there are calgary s agriculture cattie and oil industries in the surrounding acres which help the city grow and 
 multiply something else which has helped calgary s growth and popularity throughout north america and parts of the world is 
 its own people wherever they go they talk of their charming foothills city he nice people the stampede the rocky 
 mountains beyond and at present calgary s leading citizen the aayor don mackay has himself done a great deal towards 
 this end a colorful man for a colorful city aayor mackay is public relations conscious and does his best to 
 bring calgary to the attention of other cities he visits and wherever he goes he wears his white stetson the 
 mayor has even started a collection of various hats among his hats collected is a homburg from oronto a straw 
 hat from the vancouver lions a yachting cap from kelowna and his most prized hat of kll a real texas 
 stetson from the late guy weadick this hat has been hung on a peg as too valuable to be worn 
 those same famous calgary white stetsons have been given to such famous people as earl alexnder 0:alex 0:nder the duke 
 of edinburgh prime minister st laurent and others so calgary has grown from its birth in 1875 as a north 
 west mounted police fort to a town under anvas then one of wooden buildings and today into a city of 
 gradually rising buildings which lend it a fcrosperous silhouette against the backdrop of the purple foothills and jagged mountain range 
 but though st has grown by leaps and bounds calgarians are still trying to hold onto the old idea of 
 true western hospitality and friendliness for no matter where you go calgarians still proudly maintain there s nothing suite like
