 jp dl message from the colonel in chief the celebrations during 1994 of the 80th anniversary of the raising of 
 our regiment in all the battalions were as successful and enjoyable as the meticulous planning had ensured i was so 
 very pleased to be able to join in these celebrations both formal and informal and that my eldest son and 
 daughter in law whose mother comes from okotoks alberta lord and lady romsey were able to join me the only 
 sad event during the celebrations was the closure of the work point barracks home to the patricias in victoria for 
 75 years my very first visit as a new and nervous colonel in chief in 1974 was to third battalion 
 and i was struck at once by the wonderful setting of work point the re constituted third battalion now based 
 on the mainland in chilliwack is breaking pioneering ground in the way it combines militia and regular soldiers but the 
 patricia tradition of excellence will i am sure transcend the many difficulties in setting a new pattern during august in 
 1994 i was also able with my husband lord brabourne to make a third visit to croatia to see first 
 battalion another most interesting and stimulating experience i am so pleased to have been able to visit all three of 
 my battalions in different locations in croatia while engaged in their extremely difficult and testing peacekeeping duties during the twenty 
 years that i have had the honour and pleasure of being your colonel in chief i never cease to admire 
 the professional ability devotion to duty and spirit of enterprise which enthuses the patricias i am so happy to be 
 a member of the regiment for which i have such a very great admiration and affection

 cd message from the colonel of the regiment the 80th anniversary reunion last july at the home station was a 
 huge success thanks to the efforts of calgary branch of the association first battalion rear party regimental 0:regi 0:mental headquarters 
 and all those who attended one of the ceremonial events was the transfer of colonel of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment 
 responsibilities from mgen herb pitts to myself i am delighted and proud to be back in regimental service and commit 
 myself to do all that i can to further the interests of the regiment during these challenging times throughout his 
 three plus years in the appointment the dedication of mgen pitts and his genuine concern for all ranks serving and 
 retired has been exemplary typically he has moved on to other challenges 0:chal 0:lenges but will continue his commitment to 
 the patricias and we will welcome his counsel 1994 included many other momentous events third battalion departed work point barracks 
 in style and has reconfigured itself as a 10 90 battalion with headquarters in chilliwack this blending of regular and 
 militia in one unit is still experimental there are some obvious limitations but you can be sure the trial will 
 receive our best effort for the first battalion the year was devoted to service in unprofor with the battalion forming 
 canbat 1 in the krajina and providing a company to canbat 2 in bosnia both units were up to the 
 operational challenges they faced and the deployment by canbat 1 into the zone of separation was an enormous undertaking extremely 
 well executed 1994 was another demanding year for the colonel in chief accompanied by lord and lady romsey she assisted 
 the third battalion in its farewell to victoria fully participated in all aspects of the 80th anniversary reunion visited members 
 of the battle school and the loyal edmonton 0:edmon 0:ton regiment in camp wainwright and visited the second battalion in 
 winnipeg the following month accompanied by lord brabourne she visited first battalion in croatia the regiment is truly blessed to 
 have a colonel in chief who is so accessible and so dedicated to our interest the canadian defence policy published 
 in december projects a further decline in defence funding but encouragingly 0:encourag 0:ingly also recognizes an imbalance in number and 
 type of forces available it is recognized that we cannot sustain the current level of peacekeeping commitment without augmenting 0:augment 
 0:ing army and specifically infantry strength it is gratifying to see that the essential role of the infantry is now 
 policy second battalion is scheduled for service in unprofor this fall should that commitment be continued the association 0:associa 0:tion 
 annual general meeting will be held in kentville ns in september the colonel in chief will attend the agm visit 
 the combat training centre and then observe all patricia units participating in exercise ry 95 in camp wainwright the recent 
 political decision to disband the canadian airborne regiment has surprised and saddened us all we grieve with those now serving 
 and former members for the loss of this accomplished and colourful unit we share the dismay of our brothers in 
 the second airborne commando that the unbalanced media focus on the inappropriate conduct of a few has distorted the public 
 perception of the entire unit and that the overwhelming majority of tough and dedicated soldiers are now denied the opportunity 
 to correct the public record we take heart in the army s recognition that an airborne capability is an operational 
 necessity and anticipate the rebirth of the airborne esprit in a new form in the near future in conclusion let 
 me state my conviction that all members 0:mem 0:bers of the patricia family have performed with distinction this past year 
 and that we are well balanced to proudly face the challenges of 1995

 for the association and many other members of the old guard the highlight of 1994 was the 80th anniversary reunion 
 in calgary although not on the scale of the 75th with no corps of drums and not many troops on 
 the ground it was still a thoroughly enjoyable occasion it was a pleasure to renew acquaintances with comrades we hadn 
 t seen in years including a few we missed at the 75th for many it was worth the trip just 
 to see our long awaited museum for the first time and the guard provided by second battalion for the ceremonial 
 events was absolutely magnificent a reunion such as this is a major undertaking which can only succeed by the efforts 
 of many dedicated and resourceful 0:re 0:sourceful people our 75th anniversary reunion was accomplished 0:accom 0:plished with the aid of 
 personnel and material from the first battalion the strathcona s and the service battalion but with all of these units 
 on united nations operations in yugoslavia this summer our 80th anniversary committee were left with the limited resources of rhq 
 first battalion rear party and the calgary branch many would have said it couldn t be done under these circumstances 
 but this small band of serving soldiers and old guard volunteers accepted the task in true patricia fashion overcame all 
 obstacles and gave us a terrific get together the hall of honour commemorates our fallen comrades of the two world 
 wars and the korean war our recent casu alties in croatia have reminded us of our duty to memorialize those 
 members of the regiment who have died on active service since the korean war and inevitably those we will lose 
 in the future some guidelines have been established by the regimental executive and will be presented to the association for 
 approval at their annual general meeting in september the 1995 annual general meeting of the association will take place in 
 kentville nova scotia on the weekend of september 15th to 17th a warm welcome will be extended to any serving 
 patricias in the atlantic area who might want to drop in for a little socializing the colonel in chief will 
 be there and is looking forward to meeting some of the eastern members of our patricia family winnipeg has been 
 chosen as the site for the 1996 annual 0:an 0:nual general meeting we expect second battalion will be staging some 
 major event to commemorate the 45th anniversary 0:anniver 0:sary of the battle of kapyong and if they do we will 
 schedule 0:sched 0:ule or activities to coincide i would like to remind serving patricias that they are always welcome at 
 association events ere patricias in particular 0:par 0:ticular serving away from our units are encouraged to look up their local 
 association branch and get involved in their activities it s a great way to keep in touch always a patricia

 quiet but nonetheless 0:nonethe 0:less successful and meaningful our branch was proud to be the co host along with the 
 rear party 1 ppcli and regimental 0:regi 0:mental headquarters under the invaluable guidance of our co ordinator rod middleton the 
 branch members worked miracles to provide an acceptable venue and offer the best of western hospitality indeed by all accounts 
 we succeeded it was good to meet with so many friends once more for time marches on regrettably it was 
 also the last occasion for many of our comrades to meet members of the calgary branch march past during ihe 
 change of appointment parade we were equally proud to host the annual general meeting of the ppcli association much was 
 accomplished but we all recognize that much has yet to be done we certainly need more members where are all 
 the so called life time patricias come on guys put your money where your mouth is many of our branch 
 members continue to volunteer as hosts in the regimental museum it is our commitment to continue to do so including 
 to assist in running the association s 0:associa 0:tion 0:s sponsored casinos in january 1994 the calgary branch held its

 16 the patrician 1994 the 80th anniversary by capt bill lewis for patricias everywhere 1994 marked 80 years since the 
 regiment first paraded at landsdowne park ottawa in august 1914 to celebrate an anniversary reunion was held on the canada 
 day long weekend july 1 to 3 at cfb calgary s currie barracks more than 1 200 serving and former 
 members of the regiment came from across canada the united states and europe to the home station of the princess 
 patricia s canadian 0:cana 0:dian light infantry for the celebrations joining her troops for the anniversary was the regiment s 
 colonel in chief lady patricia braebourne the countess mountbatten of burma and her son and his wife the lord and 
 lady romsey the program for the 80th was balanced between social and official requirements including time on the parade square 
 for lady patricia the weekend also marked a personal anniversary as she celebrated her 20th year as colonel in chief 
 during that time she has left her home in great britain to visit the garrisons of her troops whether serving 
 at home or abroad most recently lady patricia has visited all three battalions while deployed in former yugoslavia lady patricia 
 s first official act was to preside at the opening of a new display depicting a first world war bunker 
 at the ppcli gallery of the museum of the regiments paid for by donations from friends and family of the 
 regiment the gallery s static displays videos and dioramas paint a dual picture of the unit s history the sober 
 and stark realism of the harshness of trench life faced by members of the then new regiment contrasts with the 
 pride and loyalty of the regiment s heritage another of the weekend s events was the change of appointment parade 
 of the colonel of the regiment on july 3rd the parade marked the stand down of mgen herb pitts colonel 
 of the regiment since 1990 and the appointment of mgen bill hewson to the position the parade and sunset ceremony 
 on july 3 marked the last time the ppcli band would accompany its regiment on the parade square the band 
 marched off at the end of the sunset ceremony to become part of regimental history retiring their uniforms and instruments 
 as part of the music branch downsizing as the visitors dispersed all were enthusiastic about meeting again at another reunion 
 and plans are in the works for an 85th anniversary celebration in 1999 the reunion planning committee extends its thanks 
 to everyone who helped make the anniversary a success including 0:includ 0:ing col romses and his base staff bgen jim

 by far the best training was ex semper vigilans that took place in the desert of 29 palms and at 
 the mout military operations in urban terrain site of camp pendleton in southern california phase one saw combat training in 
 the desert at 29 palms the battalion camp was set up using four man tents spread out on the desert 
 floor life was almost unbearable eating hard rations until the hogie truck arrived in no time at all the hogie 
 truck was picked clean like a water buffalo in a pool of piranha our neighbors the us marines from camp 
 lejune couldn t get a can of soda because every hogie truck for miles was parked at the canadian camp 
 with bellies filled with chili dogs and with an inexhaustible 0:inex 0:haustible supply of cheap chew from the px the 
 troops had plenty of energy to listen to information briefs on desert turtles and the dangers of the desert and 
 to participate in sonic excellent live fire training exercises these exercises started at the lowest levels and included day long 
 live fire dismounted platoon attacks and mounted company attacks ending in a hasty defence weapons fired ranged from personal 0:per 
 0:sonal weapons to light medium and heavy machine guns mortars tow and sorties from us marine flb fighters dropping 500 
 lb bombs and napalm this was some of the most ambitious training undertaken by the battalion and no smoking near 
 the gas pumps please confirmed the unit was ready for any combat situation it might face in croatia from 29 
 palms the battalion made a road move to camp pendleton aside from a water trailer catching on fire the move 
 was uneventful you can imagine the surprise of the young gas station attendant when a flaming water trailer pulled into 
 his station camp pendleton is home to the usmc mout site the marines thought we had lost our minds when 
 we pulled

 0:occa 0:sionally in making training as realistic as possible injuries military operations in urban terrain it was time to head 
 home for a bit of leave before departing for croatia without doubt our pre deployment training was a long tough 
 go but in the end we were ready for whatever we faced in the former yugoslavia house clearing pendleton style 
 did occur in one incident three troops were injured by a grenade fortunately no one was seriously hurt thanks in 
 part to the effectiveness of our new flak vests our pre deployment training was a long tough go but in 
 the end we were ready the ever present hogie trucks followed us from 29 palms keeping morale and energy levels

 only the advance party had arrived in theater quickly focused the minds of all the battalion group naturally the status 
 of cleared routes and the number of mines cleared was always a major concern the second incident just over two

 clearing the minefields in the zone of separation thereby permitting the establishment of patrol routes in the zone meanwhile the 
 co s local joint commission succeeded in getting local belligerent commanders from both sides to meet on neutral ground and 
 discuss ceasefire violations that our patrols uncovered all too often however matters could only be resolved at the highest levels 
 everyone involved in negotiations with the belligerents found the process to be a long tedious affair with lying and provocation 
 in equal measure from both sides backing down was never easy for the serbs or croats it is a matter 
 of honor was the standard excuse for anything from not surrendering weapons when they were caught inside the zone to 
 not releasing canadian troops taken hostage while doing their job charlie company was unfortunate in having a succession of the 
 most recalcitrant 0:recalci 0:trant serbs as commanders in their area all claiming to be honorable men whilst trying to perpetrate 
 the most flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement one of these violations the occupation of a pumping station that supplied 
 water to a large area of the croatian coast began a chain of events which led to mcpl isfeld s 
 death as he was clearing a minefield around the pipeline leading to the croatian side his memorial service took place

 22 the patrician 1994 memorial sen ice for pie cooper in spite the difficulties encountered and casualties sustained 0:sus 0:tained 
 the battalion s successes were many beyond establishing 0:estab 0:lishing the zone of separation largely free of belligerent forces and 
 due to the efforts of the engineers increasingly free of mines there was considerable success in the hearts and minds 
 campaign in addition to the un humanitarian relief support there was no end to the parcels of clothing and hygiene 
 supplies that arrived in the mail and were distributed by the padres the school support scheme had qualified success with 
 only the lack of building supplies preventing more ambitious construction projects from getting under way without sacrificing our own protection 
 on the ops the un protected villages of rodaljice and donnji bruska with mixed serb and croat populations enjoyed not 
 only protection but a standard of medical coverage they had not previously enjoyed of course you can t please all 
 of the croats all of the time and two notable incidents in the public rellations battle 0:bat 0:tle illustrate the 
 nature of the balkan conflict the first involved a wall which had been knocked down during a mine clearing task 
 when the engineers rebuilt it as an act of good will using serbian sand as aggregate the croats created 0:cre 
 0:ated such an incident that the wall had to be demolished and rebuilt again with croatian sand the second incident 
 centered on a magnificent altar in the roman catholic church in the village of pristeg situated on the old front 
 line between the serbs and croats in the middle of the zone of separation a cultural heritage delegation had approached 
 unprofor asking for assistance to protect this altar by moving it to a more sheltered location this request was turned 
 down as it conflicted with the sector commander s program to repopulate the zone and to reintegrate the community the 
 resulting propaganda resulted in a protest letter a not uncommon thing in sector south to the minister of national defense 
 from a group of croatian canadians in ontario complaining of how the philistine and anti catholic canbat 1 was deliberately 
 oppressing the croats in fact the opposite was true as the croats were actively persecuting unprofor by blockading the zone 
 of separation and interfering with the battalion s resupply operations recce platoon however successfully smuggled several convoys through the croation 
 blockade as a result we were the best supplied battalion in the sector until the sector headquarters decided to share 
 our supplies with the other less fortunate contingents lcol diakow hosts a meeting with the sector comd and comd ccunprofor

 the patrician 1994 23 there was the flip side however and we managed to score quite a hit on canada 
 day whist everyone had the opportunity to enjoy the traditional fare the village of karin slana played host to the 
 alternative calgary stampede after six months of peace not quiet the tour came to an end blessed by the calgary 
 stampede authorities though not graced with much financial support the stampede took form with such attractions as goat milking competitions 
 greased piglet catching sheep lassoing and bronco bucking the funfair was recreated too for the benefit of the younger stampeders 
 the day culminated in a game of canadian rules football won by the a company team long before the serbs 
 even began to understand what the rules were all about helicopters were used to lift sandbags to the most inaccessible 
 ops another high point was the visit of the colonel in chief at the end of july between them lady 
 patricia and general hewson managed to visit almost all the soldiers in the battalion both in camp and out on 
 the line and present them with their un medals the visit also provided the impetus for a battalion wide junior 
 ranks barbecue held in the idyllic setting of the beach near a company hq at karin slana at the time 
 when the troops were getting a little tired of the constant attentions of the press during their frequent visits and 
 other yip tours of dubious value such as the dnd sponsored visit of a ph d student writing a thesis

 general and mrs hewson mcpl gauthier rides the bucking bronco at the krajina stampede the battalion left its mark in 
 other ways too several new conurbations appeared over the face of the southern krajina the first being the expansion of 
 charlie company and recce platoon s camp krusty then with the move of battalion hq and admin company less the 
 quarter master south of the velebit mountains the new complex of rastevic inhabited by the rastavarians sprang up finally 0:fi

 into being only the quarter master who managed to stay north of the mountains and a company in their seaside 
 resort town of karin slana managed to avoid the urbanization process despite immense pressure to comply lady patricia presents cpl 
 hatcher with his un medal after six months of peace not quiet the tour which on reflection must have been 
 similar to the first peacekeeping 0:peacekeep 0:ing tour in cyprus came to an end a very different part of sector 
 south was handed over to the rcr though tedious 
 the patrician 1994 24 in parts and frustrating whenever dealing with the belligerents the tour was punctuated by the occasional 
 moment of excitement emergency or sheer terror while occasionally the troops had to stand back and watch the fireworks as 
 the two sides shot it out clearly the battalion managed to achieve a great deal more in the uneasy ceasefire 
 0:cease 0:fire than previous units had during the war except for having 0:hav 0:ing to throw the odd group of 
 serbs out of the zone of separation 0:sepa 0:ration the ceasefire agreement was generally upheld and a certain quality of 
 life was achieved for the people of the krajina looking back on the croatian coast from op langevin after completing 
 training in california including a 13 km march to the beach in which we were not invited to set the 
 pace we returned to canada to finish the final administration 0:adminis 0:tration required to go overseas when the battalion embarked 
 0:em 0:barked several weeks before us time slowed considerably as all we could do was wait for our rotation flights 
 b company medals parade b company op cavalier capt j n gri 1994 was an interesting year for b company 
 for most of the year we were detached to the ldsh rc battle group in order to supply infantry support 
 to op cavalier in bosnia to say that we learned a great deal about how the armoured corps operates would 
 be an understatement to say that we always enjoyed being there would be an overstatement our year began with final 
 preparations for the training exercise to be held in camp pendleton so while the oc made his way to yugoslavia 
 to conduct a recce of our future area of operations the company carried on with training including twice a week 
 13 km rucksack marches once we arrived in california we discovered that the armoured have a different view of austerity 
 than the infantry quite comfortable in the abundance of crew tents provided we began to show our entrepreneurial skills and 
 quickly established renes corner store as the place for the battle group to contribute 0:con 0:tribute to b company s 
 canteen profits our only off night came when we manned the defensives of the battle group camp and the rest 
 of the battle group discovered we had live rounds strange as it may be there was very little movement around

 the patrician 1994 25 while an advance party departed a week prior most of the company left calgary on 4 
 may arriving in visoko several days later we found that the mandate that we had trained for had all changed 
 and that rather than carrying out convoy escorts and the like we would be manning ops and checkpoints as well 
 as doing palace guard in visoko after a couple weeks of getting used to our new surroundings 0:surround 0:ings and 
 cleaning kit we went through the first of our many operational changes when we detached 6 platoon to b squadron 
 and manned the camp guard full time 4 platoon got to practice its un diplomacy and pioneer skills when it 
 replaced malaysian battalion malbat and its livestock at op m and constructed fort calgary wo mansbridge wo macdonald and sgi 
 wallace looking suitably impr their occupancy of this op was short lived however as the company was then tasked to 
 reinforce britbat to enforce the exclusion zone around gorazde with the oc stuck on a mountainside behind a broken down 
 logging truck the company began battle procedure to get everyone back to camp this led to some interesting radio traffic 
 and an even more interesting night drive for two sections from 5 platoon that had been tasked to provide security 
 at sector southwest hq in gorni vakuf after a long night of preparations the company was poised to launch at 
 noon the next day however the serb forces took offence to the company s use of tracked vehicles more changes 
 to the original plan more cross loading and another long night and finally 4 platoon company hq and an armoured 
 troop were on their way when they returned 10 days later the rest of us didn t want to hear 
 about it we had been stuck back on palace guard with another realignment of tasks b company assumed control of 
 the kiseljak pocket a croatian enclave here in the various ops and checkpoints we were to remain until the end 
 of the tour by the time we took up residence in the area there was little fighting therefore the biggest 
 threat became boredom as there was a shortage of tvs and weight training equipment new hobbies such as chain saw 
 art emerged though some people didn t see the humor in the end results our last big move of the 
 tour was to the dalmacija hotel located in downtown kiseljak while this was primarily a nightmare for the cq it 
 led to some decent if ant infested quarters and tall cans only two per day of course of naffi beer

 keep the families up to date with the latest news from the front and grease the wheels of bureaucracy when

 out of trouble an exciting patrolling exercise was conducted in the crows nest pass region of the rocky mountains each 
 of the two platoons had one week in the local training area and then deployed for a five day fighting 
 patrol over the rugged foothills in the shadow of the great divide the scenario was to locate and neutralize saboteurs 
 in the area which was made quite interesting as the enemy was made up of local rcmp constables forest rangers 
 and battalion ops staff the second platoon commanded by capt nelson had the added dimension off linking up with a 
 partisan rcmp constable bob nicholson an old hand in the crows nest pass once deployed the platoons manned ops conducted 
 section ambushes and a platoon ambush and raid the rugged terrain added to the adventure as each ridge line rose

 enjoyed an active year from the winter shakeout in shilo on ex northern strike in february to our live fire 
 battle school on ex razor s edge the year has been interspersed with service at home and abroad members of 
 2 ppcli have travelled as far south as fort polk louisiana and as far north as fort mcpherson n w 
 t in addition the battalion augmented 1 ppcli with a dozen or so all ranks for its un mission in 
 croatia throughout our tasks have been diverse and challenging varying from participation in peacekeeping to conventional exercises to assisting the 
 civil authorities in fighting fires as a result second battalion patricias have found themselves in the swamps of louisiana pounding

 personal weapons testing the battalion s winning the major unit aggregate for strong contender and the unit s first place

 of this training was a company airmobile operation on beaver bridge which was soon discovered to be surrounded by a 
 very deep and cold swamp before a company could progress to training at the battle group level a short time

 us deploying both to shilo and wainwright where we acquainted ourselves with tactical but not really tactical bivouacs including digging 
 in has anyone seen my brothers on may sth we loudly said good bye to the rest of the battalion 
 and took off for fort polk louisiana and ex omega lightning the exercise was a peacekeeping scenario and we were 
 to introduce the americans to our peacekeeping techniques and see what their techniques were like what we learned was the 
 american approach to peacekeeping 0:peace 0:keeping is to go into a situation and take over and run if 
 37 the patrician 1994 ithey did not seem content to stand and observe this turned pur exercise into a running 
 battle we were first placed in a fenced in compound unless we were wounded or dead then we conducted typical 
 un tasks ie convoy escorts foot patrols and clearance patrols however our peaceful 0:peace 0:ful escorts and patrols soon turned 
 into ambush foot patrols and practising mobile counter ambush drills many of us had just come back from croatia and 
 found this american style of peacemaking new and unusual however 0:how 0:ever we adapted and learned quickly the company used 
 miles gear and went through the actual physical evacuation process of wounded and dead personnel and receiving replacements this was 
 an excellent training aid and one that resulted in all our soldiers receiving a wake up call about the modern 
 battlefield ouch june july august and september were spent doing platoon training small party tasks and block leave all this 
 was in preparation for the month long deployment in november to fort mcpherson which was an excellent intro to the 
 north for the young soldiers and a good time for the old the company practised dismounted movement and patrols in 
 35 degrees celsius temperatures that made everyone appreciate the rangers warm tents an intro range was run for the rangers 
 for all of them to get a feel for our weapons they loved the c 9 and c 6 and 
 said how handy it would be for caribou hunting we just smiled and nodded our heads three days of machine 
 gun and team fire ranges and we were ready to go back to fort mcpherson after 15 days a shower 
 felt great even if it was cold water back in the field for a week and we were finished the 
 canadian rangers were very helpful and the townspeople would not stop feeding us we returned to winnipeg full of caribou

 38 the patrician 1994 combat support company we had a very busy 1994 in combat support company what follows are 
 some typical examples from the year mortar platoon was very busy this year spending a great deal of time in 
 the field once again we found ourselves in cfb shilo for exercise limber gunner 1994 this year proved to be 
 different from the past exercises in that our main goal was to assist in the battery commander s fireplanning course 
 during the period 14 march to 15 april we again proved to be very proficient in our job the start 
 of the exercise consisted of reviewing basic drills and flushing out the cobwebs once the live fire support was initiated 
 we gained a better insight of the daily operation of the artillery battery the training progressed slowly and eventually picked 
 up to a very fast pace the artillery officer candidates were put to the test under the close supervision 0:super 
 0:vision of their respective directing staff the exercise proved to be very beneficial for all troops involved building a better 
 working relationship with our counterparts as a result 2 ppcli mortar platoon left shilo with a strong sense of accomplishment

 set up in a bivouac beside the fire camp at the airport over the next two days the bc forest 
 service taught us safety and firefighting techniques the technique of handguarding using equipment including polaskis spades pumps and laying hose 
 the three sections under mcpls finstad mcglinchey and willcott quickly learned these new skills and the pi 2ic sgt ron

 depend on being able to recruit as many soldiers as possible this will no doubt be a lot easier when

 seven months into the 10 90 trial the regiment has benefited from the inclusion amongst our ranks of a very 
 strong willed and independent minded group of individuals known as the scottish my fellow patricias and i count ourselves as 
 friends of the scottish 0:scot 0:tish the scottish have come to 3 ppcli with a vibrant history 0:his 0:tory as 
 colourful as our own our two regiments sprang from the same soil born in the dark days of war blooded 
 in the trenches of flanders we share several battle honours ypres vimy passchendaele and amiens to name but a few 
 one very unique event that serves to distinguish one regiment from the other and has influenced the development of both 
 units down to this day was the assignment of one unit to the permanent force and the other to the 
 active militia at the end of the great war while the reality of soldiering between the wars was little different 
 very little equipment less ammunition lots of pt the cultures of the regiments diverged while the patricias developed the attitudes 
 and perspectives of the long service professional the scottish returned to the task of motivating and retaining the volunteer with 
 less than adequate resources both units arrived upon the eve of the next war in similar states ill equiped and 
 unprepared for the new mobile warfare about to break upon the world our regiments shared the drudgery of training in 
 england 0:eng 0:land the never ending schemes and exercises which never seemed to bring the end of the war any 
 closer when the patricias landed in sicily the scottish were preparing or northwest europe shortly after the patricias opened the 
 liri valley and the road to rome the scottish landed a company in normandy and secured a beachhead which would 
 eventually lead to the defeat of nazi germany the two units found themselves on the same battlefield yet again when 
 the patricias were brought north for the crossing of the ijssel and the liberation of holland the advent of the 
 cold war saw the emergence of a distinct advantage favouring the patricias the political will to provide money and equipment 
 necessary to prepare for war both regiments experienced the ups and downs of peacetime soldiering and changing political priorities and 
 each was forced to rely on the well spring of their strength during very difficult times the private soldier the 
 technical 0:techni 0:cal side of soldiering can be imparted in a relatively brief amount of time to almost any individual 
 that is why large armies exist what cannot be taught is spirit that is why regiments exist and the scottish 
 take a back seat to no one in this respect due to career courses and operational commitments the arrival of 
 the cadre has been steady since july and finally finished in november the leading edge were the pioneers 0:pio 0:neers 
 in port alberni in july who then moved down to nanaimo for an abbreviated version of the pioneer course 
 54 the patrician 1994 w alright bajema two out of three and no cocking the wrist this time just the 
 good stuff wo marchioni and sgt bajema had an interesting summer with the troops though i am not sure who 
 learned more from whom the pioneers were ably supported by the cq wo turple who in his off hours wiled 
 away the time driving his stores up and down the island highway hoping to get the opportunity to offload his 
 stuff somewhere in the greater nanaimo area next 2 ic b arrived on the ground happy to be here but 
 just a little bit confused as to who the other 2 ic b was and unsure as to why the 
 company needed two captain brister landed on his feet though and happily began torturing the cq with memos and other 
 bits of paperwork which seemed to keep the old cq off balance for most of the fall wo smith also 
 arrived at this time and took up residence in courtenay where he promptly began closely scrutinizing the walls of his 
 office thankfully he gets out more now that he has gotten into the stride of things and can be found 
 most frequently harassing prospective recruits at local schools b coy cadre were made complete with the return of csm soucie 
 from croatia in november evidently the tour in yugo made quite an impression on him as he felt it necessary 
 to do a little peacemaking of his own with several local miscreants on his front lawn the scottish down in 
 bay street may have had fewer patricias to deal with initially but there were louder ones csm thibeau ably supported 
 by wo forbes spared no effort to let the troops know that 10 90 had arrived mind you it was 
 summer and the only troops around were the orderly room staff the bluster aside they got the training year off 
 with a bang and soldiered on while the rest of the team trickled in off leave from yugo wo armand 
 and mcpl wadleigh arrived in mid november and wo murphy having left the patricias donned his kilt and moved into 
 stores as the new cq life was made much easier for csm no no i think the hot tub should 
 go over by the palm trees thibeau when captain beyer and mwo gallant arrived to form the ops cell and 
 began drafting the five or six versions 0:vers 0:ions of the regimental weekend instruction which would be required to end 
 the calender year on a suitably inspirational note while we have come a long way in the last seven months 
 it has not been easy and there remains much to be done we face many challenges and there will be 
 setbacks along the way the scottish cadre will attack these problems with tenacity and just a little bit of humour 
 one can argue the merits of the 10 90 concept the practicalities of it all but one cannot dispuyte the 
 fact that it is a very interesting place to be the scottish bring civil labour practices to pioneer pi 
 the patrician 1994 55 administration company 3ppcli the focus and main effort of administration company for 1994 was the closeout

 this process began early in the year and by mid july the majority of kit and vehicles had reached their 
 final destinations much to the amazement of our quartermaster capt bunny horlock and his overworked 0:over 0:worked section hats off

 as the maintenance facility was a very old building which required extensive renovations in fact over two hundred thousand dollars 
 was spent renovating the building which now meets our needs very nicely at the same time our new rqms mwo

 buzz words of the 19905 these buzz words applied to the battle school in 1994 as it was a year 
 of considerable change we changed hq buildings 0:build 0:ings while building 185 was renovated we changed the name of headquarters 
 coy to administration coy and then to training support coy arts and nrqs were changed to ac and nc respectively 
 we changed rsms and dcos several times plus numerous other key appointments we changed the candidate s lounge we changed 
 the battle school supply organization plus many other changes too numerous to mention some of these changes were routine and 
 a normal course of affairs in our chosen profession however most changes were aimed at improving the efficiency in the 
 way the battle school does business in these times of fiscal restraint i promised myself i wouldn t use that 
 term with the recruit tap turned back on and then off again centres of excellence responsibilities being devolved to battle 
 schools reserve collective training in full swing planning design and implementation of decentralized training being coaxed forward and the implementation

 to conduct s aic courses next year the pace of training aside the high point of this year was the

 to try his hand at coy 2ic and a oc upon maj willow s posting but it also appears he 
 was trying to take over the company clerk mrs pat gallant s job as well based on his computer and 
 keyboard prowess the one job cpl lavallee receives the best candidate award for jnco course 9401 from lcol lockyer

 for all militia training and support company the west was troubled the units of reserve ran rampant 0:ram 0:pant over 
 the land the king of western area saw this and was dismayed he summoned prince john of school and said 
 unto him go thee hence and see for thyself the disarray that abounds in our land prince john of school 
 went forth with his bold knights of good standing and saw the chaos that was he beckoned to sir murray 
 of armour and said onto him pray thou taketh these forlorn units and focus their efforts towards a common goal 
 sir murray did as the prince bade and with his omnipresent page boy little dougie at his side set about 
 selecting his men the men directed sir murray must be of stout build sound character and look good in tights 
 for in those days it was important to look good little dougie set forth searching high and mostly low for 
 such men with no gain in his travels he discovered that most of the men taken to the wearing of 
 tights were under the employ of sir gotthardt of leader little dougie had no problem finding stout men because all 
 the men of stately stature were employed by sir el of recruit the land was scoured for such men and 
 finally the required 0:re 0:quired number were found sir murray looked upon these men and was pleased he then set 
 about to carry out prince john s direction and mtsc was born that is not really how it was but

 again when rhq requests that all patricias be they in battalion or on ere take pen in hand and submit 
 a short narrative reflecting on the accomplishments of their unit during the past training year for any unit that could 
 be a time consuming endeavour for an organization as diverse as the combat training centre it is positively overwhelming suffice 
 to say that several courses were taught here in 1994 from small arms instructor to infantry ql7 with everything else 
 imagineable in between this training was conducted in part due to the large number of patricia s employed here in 
 gagetown you are probably asking yourself just how many patricias are there anyway in response to this burning question i 
 will use this article to provide a brief review of the cast of patricia thousands that work here in virtual 
 anonymity did i say thousands well not quite the regimental representation in gagetown now numbers a whopping 83 god fearing 
 western lads here amongst all these heathen lower canadians the majority of these stalwart soldiers are employed in the school 
 of foot under the tuteledge of major blekaitis while the rest toil away at other glamorous 0:glamor 0:ous jobs in 
 ctc hq and trials and evaluations major blekaitis still wears the mantle of chief instructor and can frequently be seen 
 passing on the benefit of his experience with the opening line of well old d0g a line that junior officers 
 have come to recognize as notice of an impending task in this fight to instill knowledge into the heads of 
 wayward young officers he has recently been joined by major drew the new oc a coy for those that know 
 major drew you will understand when i say that he has been a virtual breath of fresh air to the

 those who served on united nations tasks with the regiment to show and join the association as well these numbers 
 are growing substantially with each rotation a year in saskabush is not like any other here support 0:sup 0:port comes 
 from an air base where they question the need for 60mm mortar sabots or insect repellant but see a greater 
 need for cap badges on air force blue toques actually things can be good when we have a chance to 
 talk with the support base personnel stereo types exist on both sides like anywhere else so effort is sometimes needed 
 to work around them one of the most challenging jobs is to keep training interesting progressive and maintain some continuity 
 0:conti 0:nuity while the more senior soldiers are away on tasking with the regiment the constant turn over is often 
 greater than the regiment faced during the boom times of the late seventies during the past year everyone was kept 
 busy planning supporting and helping to execute a normal training season this included various exercises the lfwa shooting team and 
 the battle schools the whole focus is on providing the best possible trained and motivated soldiers to support tasks when 
 they are needed the general quality of reserve soldiers in the west is steadily improving and as more achievable common 
 and concentrated standards are utilized the more competent they become we hope the next year is interesting fun and above 
 all else safe for everyone if you are passing through do not hesitate to check in to see in to 
 see what is happening it is possible quench a thirst though the fog here can be worse than in either 
 bc or the maritime albeit it is generally self induced lastly the grey cup will be in regina this year

 grand party ppcli association saskatchewan branch the gopher province is alive and well after all our news is always old
