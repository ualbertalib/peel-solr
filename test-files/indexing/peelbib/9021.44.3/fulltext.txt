 1996 by archie m pennie it is hard to believe that over fifty years have passed since a little hamlet
 in alberta was a second home to hundreds of young british boys who made it their base for about eight
 weeks while they learned the rudiments of flying the place was bowden sixty miles north of calgary on the cpr
 line the airfield 32 elementary flying training school was located at buffalo creek about two miles north of the hamlet
 the land chosen for the air field belonged to two farmers george wilson and john thompson construction began immediately after
 the land transfers and the station opened for flying in july 1941 it was one of the five elementary flying
 training schools operated in canada by the british commonwealth air training plan the others were at de winton south of
 calgary caron and assiniboia in saskatchewan and neepawa in manitoba i joined the royal air force in 1942 leaving a
 government position involved in research on explosives and propellants at woolwich our overseas draft left for halifax on h m

 was hammock 86 c deck proved to be a holding unit and we stayed there for really in the bowels
 of the ship with several weeks waiting for a posting to portholes permanently closed as our first flying school it
 certainly was a airmen we were crowded into these pleasant break in our journey for we dimly lit holds never
 allowed to take off revelled in the great varieties of food our clothes and living in very close fruit and
 of course the freedom from the quarters the majority of men spent blackout that made britain so dull and most
 of the time physically sea sick grim one of our great treats was to vkit creating a far from pleasant
 and sanitary shediac and buy fresh lobsters from the environment fishermen for twenty cents each once off the ship we
 boarded a special eventually we were mustered in the drill train and were welcomed to canada by a hall and
 informed that we were posted to delightful group of women volunteers 32 efts bowden in alberta none of they showered
 us with all sorts of us had ever heard of the place but some goodies some of which we had
 not seen ventured a guess that it was near the in britain since rationing took over first rockies our special
 train consisted of stop on the rail line was truro where we colonist cars with hard wooden seats and were
 allowed off the train for about half rather uncomfortable upper and lower an hour i wandered over to the main
 bunks the trans canada journey was an street and spotted a shop with bananas in eye opener and an education
 as we rolled the window bananas had not been along through province after province available in britain since the beginning
 watching the country change from of the war and i rushed into the s 1 iop woodland to lakes and
 rock to the none of us had any money either british everlasting prairie stretching from one or canadian currency but
 the shop girl horizon to the other each day we kept willingly gave me a banana in exchange expecting to
 see the rockies strange but for a button off my tunic i walked out that was the one feature that
 all of us into the street and when my companions wanted to see on the final morning the saw the
 banana they dashed into the cry went up the rockies and soon we shop cleared out the stock of bananas
 were at calgary and left the girl with a jar of raf buttons a change of trains and north we
 went we were much surprised when we 3 i personnel depot moncton was our stopped at a nondescript hamlet and
 first destination and we arrived there even more surprised when we later in the day first order was to have

 carlton i may say from the forks of the saskatchewan to the distance from lac la biche to lac la
 biche is an undulating plateau victoria by an air line is about 70 miles varying from 1 500 to 1
 700 feet above but by the trail it is 100 miles at the sea level but with clumps of hills
 latter post we met mr hardisty and his running 100 to 200 or 300 feet higher family from edmonton they
 had come the plateau is semi prairie with plains down for a pleasure trip and were going of considerable extent
 alternating with to return by the steamer which was tracts more broken with streams and alberta history summer 1996 lakes
 all the latter abounding in white they supposed to be a spur of the rocky fish the hills are more
 or less covered mountains this is not the case they with patches and belts of poplar those fall off to
 the south west and in about 20 bordering on the saskatchewan are the to 25 miles die out altogether below
 the highest and they gradually decrease in mouth of the mcleod river and there is altitude northward a wide plain
 between them and the rocky mountains covered with timber there is no true forest within 50 from these hills lying

 nearly willows etc or second growth but indian trail direct from edmonton to there are large patches and belts in
 the fort assiniboine and thence to st john up to the river as i found trunks hollows by lakes and
 swamps of spruce follows this river leaving slave lake to and tamarack of good quality well the right the smoky

 300 feet wide bridges the soil generally is a rich fordable in autumn when it is about knee clayey loam
 well adapted for wheat deep a spur of the rocky mountains various stages of decay growing on the hills the
 soil is lighter comes down to this point on the west but produces good grass and pea vine side of
 the river so that the trail is and is fine pasture land deflected to the north following down the smoky
 river valley a few miles then at edmonton there were a great number it ascends the west side by a
 lateral of indians assembled and several stream on to the beaver plains a fine officers of the h b co
 who were now tract of semi prairie lying between the peace river and the rocky mountains or had formerly been
 stationed at the posts north of edmonton from those i and stretching up and into the pine river pass got
 a great deal of information about the country between the athabasca and peace rivers up to the foot of the
 rocky mr john brown whom i had sent from mountains they all agreed as to its carlton round by battleford
 had arrived being a very fine country semi prairie at edmonton three days before me and right up to fort
 st john on the peace sent the pack train on the new trail to the river hut this fertile belt
 varying i i athabasca to meet me expecting me breadth is almost cut in two by the from lac la

 tempted to seize the and south west from that lake i had opportunity of this return of this pack some
 veiy intelligent indians engaged train to b columbia to go through by several days in making sketch maps of the
 pine river pass which notion was the country showing the streams hills strongly combatted by the prudent and and trails
 mr hardisty also took great cautious john brown we found there interest in my enquiries and acted was no trail

 copious than that of any other tribe as the h b co take their stores by boat i had hitherto
 met i have really got a between these points there is much very reliable knowledge of the country timber some
 muskegs and the season had been very wet so that there would be you may remember that messrs much labour
 cutting trail and brushing horetzky and macoun travelled by fort or corduroying nsuskegs the season assiniboine on the athabasca and
 on was far advanced 20 th august so that the north west side of the river crossed a there was
 no probability of being able to very high and rough range of hills which reach st john either by that
 route or by alberta history summer 1996 desire on brown s part that i should go with him we found
 that i could do this and go to victoria and back by san francisco to winnipeg in only about a
 week or ten days more time than it would take to go back by the plains and at less expense

 the old trail by was one of the most disagreeable parts which you travelled this was a good we struck
 the athabasca about of our journey on account of the great trail in octr 1876 but a tornado had number
 of wasps nests on the trail crossed since then and it took all our 25 miles below fiddle river and
 which being stirred up by the mules the party 12 hours to cut a passable trail wasps stung them to
 madness and they through the windfall which extended camped over sunday on a grassy would rush frantically through the two
 miles one day we only made five woods tearing the packs off their backs miles and the next day 15
 miles across knoll with a magnificent view of rearing and kicking it was hard to avoid long portage or bend
 of the mcleod being dashed against the trees we all striking that river again near your plum escaped however without
 serious injury pudding camp 5 there we met a family the rocky mountains though with many scratches and bruises of
 half breeds from jasper house 6 who the heavy rains that flooded manitoba had letters for several of our party
 from had extended well up to the rocky the men at athabasca depot who were mountains and destroyed all the
 small reported to have been murdered these bridges that had been made the previous half breeds had left them in
 good health year for the survey supplies but every and there had been no difficulty with man in the party
 had an axe and one half indians this put us in good spirits and of them started every morning the
 rest of our journey was one of immediately after breakfast to replace unallayed pleasure some of the half bridges brush
 swampy places and clear breeds turning back with us the trail of fallen timber though they got two hours or
 more the start of the we took moberly s trail which leads others they were invariably overtaken by over a
 high hill on the divide between the packers before noon and for the rest the mcleod and athabasca you took
 of the day all hands used their axes the h b trail on low ground farther to the north and
 had some bad muskegs to sunday aug 26 th all day hi camp wallow through we struck the usual work
 washing mending and athabasca about 25 miles below fiddle sorting luggage had prairie chicken for river and camped over sunday
 on a breakfast two of them shot by mr brown grassy knoll with a magnificent view of yesterday the only
 things we have seen the rocky mountains to right left of us on this road except a pelican 3 we
 had forded the pembina but the mcleod was too high and we used the mouth of medicine creek where the
 line crosses we had a very bad trail for some miles before reaching the mcleod a great many muskegs and
 we only boats crossing about ten miles below made 10 miles in one day following up the bank of the
 mcleod the trail was i y n c a ¼ good except in places where there was fallen timber which
 delayed us we had h ‘ ‘ fine views of the rocky mountains in the distance on our left they
 rise up very boldly and are more broken and peaked than i had expected to find them and more resembling
 the cascade chain as seen from points west of the fraser alberta history summer 1996 barnard 8 who offered 1
 000 for it when the prime cost at kamloops the packing and watching it afterwards brought the cost over 6
 000 i have ii locked it up and put it in charge of the ‘ i us paying them before
 hand with 6 months supplies and they are to have no half breed family who accompanied wages brown knows the
 family well and says they are thoroughly reliable this will save the cost of keeping the two f men there
 to watch it at 1 440 a year wages and their board a i got drawings and description of the
 indian trail from jasper house to the peace river it goes up the assiniboine river between high ranges in the
 heart of the rocky mountains and down the was the noble miette rock full in front porcupine river to the
 peace near a fort like a huge portal guarding the entrance which i cannot recognize under its into the pass
 beyond which far in the indian name but i suppose it is distance we had glimpses of the snow dunvegan
 it is described as a good trail peaks that mark the summit of the pass with not much fallen timber
 plenty of we crossed the athabasca by canoe at grass for animals and no bad streams to the mouth of
 fiddle river and camped ford the indians travel it sometimes in under the lea of a huge rock four days
 and they say we could go in six or seven days with a pack train next day the ride was
 the most charming that i have ever had on the surveys we we took leave of john brown and one
 kept clear of the valley trail made for the man who returned to edmonton and above survey parties keeping well
 up the side proceeded on our way westward we had of the mountain north of the valley and much less
 difficulty than you had as the in 877 marcus smnith sketched this view of we had glorious views of the

 to work the trail march 4 th 1910 we had a elizabeth mcnaught farm this we did thus mr mcnaught
 was free and could leave for the west caboose on a sleigh in which we without being burdened with the
 running the winter of 1909 my husband mr of the farm stowed cooking utensils beds samuel mcnaught heard of a
 number of men and their wives who were going in the spring of 1909 he and the party and everything
 useful in this west from ontario so he decided to left for the west stopping off at accompany them he
 had a keen intei est edmonton to outfit and to learn more of in the west having spent a summer
 the country dr mckay living in wee house our family lived edmonton at the time had in his travelling in
 manitoba when there was no train west of winnipeg and some younger days been a hudson s bay co doctor
 in that part of the west they people were still using red river carts wished to explore so he knew
 the later he had an interest in a horse ranch country he consented to receive mr near calgary often travelling
 horseback gaudin and mr mcnaught for ten as far west as banif rounding up horses minutes when they met him
 and told now hearing of the last great west he him their names he said mcnaught wanted to explore it
 that is a good name and started to tell them of the grande prairie country it above our farm where
 my husband was born was one o clock when he started and the bells were ringing six when they left
 was situated three miles west of portrait oft ic tittthor eli aheth brantford on the road which runs from him
 they learned more of the mcnaught mmianv vear s a icr she had between london and hamilton it was a
 grande prairie country than all the maps hecomne a piomleer f the peace river lovely old place the scenery only
 that were advertising it he advised them di stm ict to go on saying they would get there if lacking
 water to make it nearly perfect they were the right kind of men a young englishman boarding near us had
 always admired the place because it edmonton was the terminus of the raillooked like the farms in england so road
 the problem was how to travel alberta history summer 1996 horses would need oats and hay while months residence had
 to be done on oxen and sleighs were decided on to get possession of the land six oxen could do
 with hay only which both the south african scrip and that were situated along the trail tents much land each
 year for three years r could be procured from stopping places homestead as well as cultivating so i ‘ ‘
 4 a and all that goes with them to make a this meant my husband would have to party of
 land prospectors comfortable be away three years if he was to make ‘ c 15 5 were bought and the
 party started good his claim the land could not be procured in any other way money ‘ the first one
 hundred miles was north of would not buy it i persuaded my j edmonton to athabasca landing a husband to
 allow the children and me to a small village on the athabasca river accompany him renting the farm in the
 from there it was a long hard trip east for three years then if we wanted ‘ i i 4
 some places they had to make the road to return we had our home to come to and found a
 beautiful rolling prairie in the house everything else sold and finally they arrived in grande prairie furniture useful on our
 return was stored country dotted with bluffs mr we were ready to start mcnaught went across the a ‘ i
 beaverlodge river then ten miles my husband decided to take a hired man further west to what was known as
 the and boy so we would have help on the ‘ red willow country the rest of the journey they
 left brantford ahead of the party decided to settle on the east side of children and me as it would
 take some the beaverlodge river thus the land time to buy supplies and get generally chosen by mr mcnaught was
 the outfitted at edmonton we were to meet farthest west them when they were ready to start which we did
 we started on the long here he was ahead of the surveyors long trail march 4 th 1910 his first
 choice turned out to be a school section the surveyor said as he we had a caboose built on a
 sleigh in every day was warm and the had south african scrip which entitled which we stowed cooking utensils beds
 him to 320 acres of land and also and everything useful in this wee house homestead rights which gave him
 160 our family lived the men had another sleighing was now completely acres he thought he might not be able
 sleigh loaded to capacity with groceries to locate that much land on a school of every description and supplies for
 a finished as the slave river section he made a second choice and year or more the men s beds
 were was able to put in his application with rolled in canvas and they slept in the became a wild
 torrent of rushing vacant land nearby should he want to stopping houses along the way all procure more it had
 taken much longer travellers were expected to bring their water and broken ice to get into the country than anyone
 bedding and meals while the houses thought by the time a log cabin and supplied heat and shelter stable were
 put up it was time for mr mac to start back east mr drake a friend of ours travelled with
 his team and outfit at the same time a settler adam dorm was going to so we were a party
 of three teams and edmonton for his year s supplies he had outfits before we left edmonton my a good
 team of horses and sleigh so mr husband decided to buy another south mac engaged his passage with him the
 african scrip in my name in this way he surveyors were also returning east and could get possession of another
 three part of the time they travelled together hundred and twenty acres of land he dorm s team was the
 best travellers so hoped to locate it along side the land they arrived at edmonton first from already picked out
 so that altogether we there to brantford was a few days by rail would have a farm of eight hundred
 and somewhere about the new year acres 1910 my husband arrived home fully determined to go back to the west
 to mr mac was a westerner by choice so make good his claim but to leave the he was looking
 forward to an ideal farm children and me at home in the east he had been careful to examine both
 soil alberta history summer 1996 and subsoil and had chosen what to him i was the best for myself the
 bridges e a were not burned behind me i was 3 looking forward to going back when the when the
 duties were done that would 4 a give us possession of the land a a i s 4 a the
 first night on the trail was stormy a snow falling so fast the trail was filled it i ‘ e
 44 •• ‘ frightened me because i had an idea the ‘ ‘ ‘ i ‘ ‘ farther north you
 went the colder and ‘ l 9 f stormier it got it had often snowed on the fourth of march
 in ontario but this ‘ i was north of edmonton and that made a p 5 all the difference i
 the first part of the journey was one hundred miles north of edmonton to athabasca landing we were several days
 reaching it and before we went up ‘ ‘ the last hill the snow had melted and we pulled up
 on mud so rapidly had the 1 drive on ice up the athabasca and slave weather changed we had planned
 to rivers then across slave lake to grouard on the north side of slave lake now the problem was would
 the ice be mrs norris the owners of the place safe mr mac consulted bishop were very friendly and made
 me feel holmes of the anglican church who quite safe to be left behind the men was in athabasca landing
 his advice decided to store part of the freight at was to start at once and travel close to mirror
 landing as the roads were very the shore as much as possible the ice heavy this freight they would have
 to would be thin but it was shallow the return for in the summer danger would come when we had
 to cross the river but he thought even that when we were ready to start again the would be safe
 if we made good time caboose had to be taken down and we travelled on wagons using stopping his advice
 was followed and the sleighs places until we reached sawridge at the often cut through the ice where it was
 east end of lesser slave lake there the left shallow when we finally came to the caboose was to be
 put on the sleighs for place to leave the river ice was none too us to cross slave lake on
 the ice this i s a view of rtpical irat ellecs on safe but we crossed and pulled up the
 their wa to the peace river countr im opposite bank on mud to a village called we camped at sawridge
 while the 9 i iii the wagon are harry coate s mirror landing every day was warm change was made
 from wagons to and mm emnersami and the sleighing was now completely sleighs i bought enough cranberries above finished as
 the slave river became a from indians for five gallons of jam wild torrent of rushing water and broken which
 i stored in a five gallon stone thi s map shows time route takemi by time ice from mirror landing
 to slave lake churn tom lilac the stopping house mcnaught party in 1910 the roads got worse every day wagons
 proprietor got me in touch with the were bought and loaded trailing the women they knew where to pick the
 sleighs behind to use on lesser slave berries and we found these made lake where the ice did not break
 up delicious jam after being out all winter early it took two loads on wagons for one on sleighs while
 the men were the ice on the lake was apparently safe freighting back and forth the children so when everything
 was ready we and i were left in the caboose at a started there was a party of surveyors stopping
 place on slave river mr going west at the same time and they had alberta history summer 1996 a chef
 who made first class bread he hauled back first then the loads and gave me some valuable instructions on everybody
 was thankful when we were making bread that came in useful back on safe ice again now the problem we
 were on the rotten ice especially when we arrived at our was how to reach shore which was still a
 journey s end on the trail we stopped mile away and no trail mr mcnaught only for one meal when
 bannock was went ahead on foot trying the ice he before we knew it the alarm made bacon fried or
 anything else was found a new trail and we landed safely cooked that did not require much time about a
 mile east of grouard the noise was given and the teams all this is when the jam was used for
 fruit of the sleighs grinding on the gravel as then in the evening a hot dinner was we reached the
 shore was one of the best stopped enjoyed by all sounds i ever heard although the most unmusical and we
 all breathed easy for along the south shore were stopping several days we lived in the caboose at places where
 we could find shelter and grouard where many travellers were feed for the teams at night at first the there
 like ourselves getting ready to start ice made fine sleighing and we were out again at an indian settlement making
 good time the surveyors went nearby the indians caught white fish ahead of us crossing the lake then a under
 the ice and brought them for sale messenger came from them warning us there were white people running the of
 rotten ice ahead one of their horses stores and stopping places and all had broken through it had got out
 but together they were a cosmopolitan lot the ice was dangerous most of the travellers were bound for the peace
 river country this message was misconstrued and we were on the rotten ice before we knew it there was the
 choice of two routes one the wagons were tied behind the sleighs went mostly west across the simmonette and the
 caboose was at the end i and smoky rivers the other went north happened to see the wheels of the
 wagon ahead cut through the ice the alarm was to peace river crossing crossed the given and the teams all
 stopped long peace then went to dunvegan crossed handled forks were used to prod the ice the peace river again
 and went on south and these showed we were on a mass of to grande prairie both routes were rotten
 ice the teams were unhitched equally muddy and offered us the and hitched to backs of sleighs as they prospect
 of being held up by broken ice dared not turn them around with their in the big rivers which would
 not allow heavy loads the caboose being last was the ferries to run alberta history summer 1996 our party choose
 the peace river route both flowing north the town of peace the weather continued to be warm with river is
 on the flat a short distance above bright sunshine every day so it was a the river at the bottom
 of the hill it was pleasure to be outdoors the travellers the usual small northern town with both had all
 expected to go in on sleighs so hudson s bay and revillon stores and summer weather in march was a
 roman catholic and anglican missions surprise to all and had it not caused so much havoc with the roads we
 would the ice in the river had partly gone out have been enjoyed it and the ferry was running and
 landing people on a large block of ice on the at grouard a tent was bought and opposite side when
 it came our turn to left top everything was again changed to cross over the ferryman said you are wacons
 the weather was so delightful the last to go over until that block of ice this view shows settlers arriving
 iii the that it was no hardship to sleep under on the other side moves out he was peace river
 area usimig the same canvas at night we set up the stove and afraid of it going with people on
 it just mnethods as the mcnaughts whemi the had our dinner or supper and breakfast as the last of our
 party was leaving the warmmi weather caught up with themn then the tent was taken down and for ice it
 began to go one of the oxen went they too had to avoid the ice on the lunch at noon
 we had a campfire and through but got out just in time the lakes mostly ate with the bright blue
 sky river here is both deep and wide above top above us as the stopping places were none too inviting
 the trail on the other side was not far these settlers en route to the peace above the river but
 back from it when river am ea wem e able to use wagons i remember one stopping house between we
 camped the first night we were still although there was still snow on the grouard and peace river that looked
 in the valley above the river near the ground both clean and homelike there was a residence of allie brick
 the member of crude built fireplace which gave out such the legislature for this district his a bright light when
 the fire was lit that buildings and farm showed he had been we decided to use it especially as we
 in the country for years the next happened to be the only travellers there morning our journey led up the
 hill out at the time we all enjoyed the change of the valley of the peace it was a delightful
 morning and the grass at the just before we got to the peace river we side of the trail was
 dry so mr mac came upon a magnificent view the road proposed we all walk up the hill we was
 one thousand feet above the river so could take all the time we needed as the from the top of
 this hill we see two teams had to rest after pulling up the mighty rivers the smoky and peace heavy
 loads alberta history summer 1996 we all enjoyed it but my daughter mary thermometer soon after i had taken it
 in who did not want to walk she cried and the afternoon when it was 104 1 always said daddy
 i don t want to walk thought it was a blessing i did not know when that had no weight
 she said just how high it went that night the town of peace river is on daddy i won t
 walk but mary walked and we were all amused for the men took the teams and loads across the flat
 a short distance above daddy and mary seldom disagreed at the peace river on the dunvegan ferry the top of
 the hill is a wonderful view so and camped across the river that night while the loads were being pulled
 up we the next morning we went over now the river at the bottom of the the long hill had
 to be climbed again sat there and enjoyed it this time there was no chance to walk on hill it
 was the usual small account of the mud we climbed the hill from there to dunvegan we went and our
 route now was south to the northern town with both through a beautiful farming country grande prairie district by nightfall
 we waiting to be settled mr mac was afraid had reached esplen brothers farm near it would be hard to
 get water as there spirit river they did everything hudson s bay and revillon stores seemed to be so few
 springs only possible to make the children and me sloughs from which we got water for comfortable when we slept
 in their and roman catholic and use we boiled the water so it did us no house crosbie was not
 getting any harm one night we camped where the better and there was no doctor to be had anglican missions
 ground was spongy the men did not the anglican niission at spirit river like the place but it was nearly
