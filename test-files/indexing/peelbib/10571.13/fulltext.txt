 the printing of the patrician in a form more suitable to the regimental journal of princess patricia s canadian light 
 infantry it is not an easy business to arrange the financial support necessary for the printing of a regimental magazine 
 however sufficient progress has been made in that direction for us to express the strong hope that our next issue 
 will appear properly turned out and a distinct improvement on past efforts tie have therefore included this number in our

 127 regimental events a review by major j n edgar m c a review of the history of princess patricia 
 s canadian light infantry discloses the fact that each calendar month of the year claims for itself a major incident 
 in the life of the regiment during the croat y7ar 1914 18 with the exception of december and january which 
 months respectively claim a the arrival of the regiment in prance and b the initial introduction of the regiment to 
 trench warfare 0:war 0:fare the gencrol battles and local engagements in which the unit took part would appear to be 
 distributed amongst the remainder 0:re 0:mainder ranging between st el ci in february 1915 to moii3 in november 1918 the 
 spring months of liar oh april and may are of particular significance in the recording of regimental events as this 
 portion of the calendar includess 1 17th marchf st patrick s day birthday of our colonelin chief 0:colonel 0:in 0:chief 
 lady patricia ramsay and commemoration of the return 0:re 0:turn of the regiment to canada from overseas 1919 2 20th 
 march 1915 the death of the first commanding officer lt col d darquhar d 5 0 at voormezeele from wounds 
 received at st eloi a 3 9th april 1917 r the battle of vimy ridge 4 bth may 1915 the 
 battle of brezenberg it is hardly feasible to expect a unit with a list of battle honours to celebrate all 
 its major achievements even should they have the desire or inclination to do so however the more significant are selected 
 as a means of keeping alive regimental traditions according to circumstances it may bo appropriate to record that tho birthday 
 of the gracious lady whose name we have the privilege and distinction to bear is an event which the present 
 unit includes as an annual celebration the nature of the celebration appeared to fluctuate each year between an informal gathering 
 of all ranks when the senior officer present outlines the significance of the occasion following which he proposes a toast 
 to our colonel in chief to which everyone responds as a moons of oxpressing 0:ox 0:pressing birthday wishes and a 
 formal regimental bance or a regimental smoker in winnipeg each year the celebrations include a form of entertainment which would 
 appear somewhat novel teams of officers sergeants junior n c os and men engage in broom loo a game played 
 on the open air ice rink without skotes an ordinary football is used and by the use of an old 
 broom the q m saves all disused brooms from one year to another for this purpose one is expected to 
 use one s ingenuity and dexterity 0:dex 0:terity efforts to maintain one s equilibrium is a means of 
 128 eliminating any signs of individual ability for tho purpose of persuading said football to deposit itself in the opposing 
 goal this part of tho celebration is very humorous and usually 0:us 0:ually lays a good foundation for the events 
 to follow ex members of the regiment now formed into patricia clubs take advantage of the occasion to celebrate the 
 birthday of their coloncl iivchicf by organizing social gatherings ottawa toronto winnipeg regina saskatoon and vancouver arc centres where old 
 members of tho regiment foregather for the purpose of celebrating such outstanding regimented events as the 17th marsh each year 
 some of the n unes of these particularly active in the administration of patricia clubs throughout the country arc the 
 following ottawa tommy eeaslip toronto doc harris bill jordan winnipeg george barclay jim puller regina art bon r charlie little 
 saskatoon arthur potts bick herbert vancouver lyall brasher charlie palmer macgregor mcintosh if l a the month of march and 
 incidentally the 17th also records the arrival of the regiment in halifax upon its return to canada following its four 
 years participation in the great war those privileged to return home with the unit will doubtless remember the commanding officer 
 s first act upon reaching canadian soil a cable to england to our coloncl in chief s happiness and birthday 
 pishes from all ranks of your regiment in being asked to carry the torch the wish and desire of the 
 present regiment is that our colonel in chief may long be spared to receive moony more such birthday wishes the 
 anniversary of tho battle of prezcnberg this year willi i am sure be celebrated and remembered by all past and 
 present members of the regiment with the reverence that the passing of years has built up for us as in 
 the pact years memorial services will he held at winnipeg and victoria at which personnel of the present unit stationed 
 at these centres will attend ex members of the regiment located in these districts will again bo invited to march 
 to the church at the head of the present serving members for the purpose 6f taking part in these ceremonies 
 following the services wreaths will be laid on the local war memorials last post a two minute silence and reveille 
 errls the tribute to tire memory of these who by their courage loyalty and spirit of self sacrifice laid down 
 their lives at frezenberg in the regiment 1 s gallant stand against german cttacks designed to reach the channel ports 
 the impressive nature of these cermonics and the opportunity they afford for the new patricia 3 to march with the 
 old limers has been a further means of transferring to the regiment in peace the consolidation of those high ideals 
 created and mar cained so successfully by the old regiment throughout the pe 7 iod of the great wo r

 unfortunately there is not as in the imperial army a military school of music from which muscians may be recruited 
 and naturally more effort is necessary to keep the band up to scratch then again the fact that we are 
 at present insofar as a bandmaster is c scorned an acephalous organisation and still using antiquated instruments of the high 
 pitch type enhance the difficulties however despite the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune hope has not been entirely fehandoned

 have been ordered from london england and that within the course of a month or so they should be in

 a small busy office and settle oneself to reco ru the activities of the past quarter outside the plum and

 nodding heads of a myriad of flowers beckon to soft grassy slopes in the sun and inside there is the 
 jaring caco hnqf of an orderly rooms bells typewriters steel heels you know it all but spring is quite definitely 
 here and the beauty of bright sunny days and the gorgeous colours of april must gladden the dullest of us 
 once again we are able to get our sections and platoons together and issue forth minus raincoats and the other 
 paraphernalia of winter and with spring tuaining of course come fcj thoughts of approaching caup but to retrace the 17th 
 of march found n b company as usual thoroughly engrossed in the affairs of the school of infantry at noon 
 however we all gathered together to drink to the good health of our colonel in chief and as many of 
 us as could manage it took a l oliday in the afternoon things being as they are here in esquimalt 
 the xth is a most difficult time to arrange a large celebration plans are now under way for our annual 
 church parade on bth may last year several old comrades marched with us and we hope this year to add 
 greatly to their numbers b company said good bye to lieut h a prince 6th gurkha rifles on march the 
 first his stay at escpaimalt was thoroughly enjoye d by ourselves at least and wo all wish him a pleasant 
 journey and good luck for the future some time before he left mr prince gave b company a lecture on 
 service life on the north jest frontier of india this proved both entertaining and enlightening and left us with one 
 more clear glimpse of how the rest of show the other half of the world lives another treat somewhat previous 
 in date which members of b company had was a talk on india by captain j b gordon puff the 
 fie brigade wider in scope this vivid address gave us all a nod picture of soldiering in india and of 
 the why and wherefore of it all captain gordon puff has lately been talcing a very active part in our 
 section and platoon training here at the coast very much ay we add to our benefit ooco 0000

 very successful meetings its object is to encourage young and ambitious pipers and the committee are working hard to that

 the form of an unofficial display of what the various units and clubs could our pipers rather walked away with

 144 the chasseurs alpins toy lieut h f cotton in trying to write an interes ir g report on a 
 visit to foreign army one is up against the queaxion of whether to irujs u it a concise military report 
 or to emulate the popular novelist 0:novel 0:ist and garnish the text with personal anecdotes a 00hjpro3bi se to me 
 to bo tfj oest way of describing the most interest ing four weeks which i have just put in after 
 weeka of waiting i was informed by the tsbr office that i nets to do an attachment of one month 
 to the 13th battalion of the chasseurs alpins situated on the italian frontier i journeyed without event across a troubled 
 channel through france and arrived at chambcry in savoie at 10 p m on 0:p 0:m 0:on a saturday night 
 a lieutenant of the 13th in full drsfto grande tonue was at the station to meet me he spoke littl 
 z english probably on a par with my french however he in formed mc that i was to change immediately 
 into my full drees and to go with him to a ball being given in the hotel do villo that 
 evening my luggage h d been checked from vibtori 5 station direct to chambery the nearest customs being aisles bains 
 0:ais 0:les 0:bains ten o clock on a saturday night the custom are closed but nothing daunted my friend woke 
 up the chief customs officer by phone and explained the situation a general lent us his staff car and chauffeur 
 and off we went to av t ies bains on arrival no luggage one to be found so i w 
 s allowed to retire to a much needed bed in the hotel do branca the next day being sunday i 
 was able to get my bearings and met the single officers who do not live in a mess but board 
 out eating at a common rendezvous this rendezvous happened to be in my hotel they have a separate dining room 
 which is called a popotte at thia stage i would like to describe in detail the popotte of the 13th 
 chasseurs alpins there were about eight young officers dining the others all being married r h senior is called the 
 president about ten minutec before dim ci cy lunch the officers begin to arrive in the lobby 0 every one 
 salutes each other and shakes hands with all in toon wis shaking hands business is a serious affairs whenever you 
 met an officer you salute and shake hands the smne when you parte bhon cvoyu c ia seated at the 
 table the officer of the pay roads out ha menu in a chant which represents the tune of the put 
 talior of the day there are thirty battalions of the chasseursf active and reserve in france each battalion has a 
 motto and r trumpet call the motto of the 13th being sans pain sons i riat lo trt izj eme 
 no bo i t que de l eau the officers alive ya add dans lour pernod pernod being aperitif 
 145 the chasseur daily menu is as followss reveille hot ohoclate or coffee breakfast bread cheese and coffee lunch a 
 meat vegetable and sweets litre of win r tea hot pot choosey bread and litre of wine the average british 
 or canadian soldier would story to death on this diet and yet these freuojji soldiers can march twenty kilometres on 
 bread and cheese which is a normal hnve w sack ration uhlfadf turnout the chasseurs are the only unit in 
 the french army that have boon permitted to keep the dark blue uniform 0:uni 0:form they wear he vy ammunition 
 boots dork blue puttees trousers and jackets with a blue stock for the neck a large black beret is worn 
 on the head the officers and sous officei have kepis for barrack and town life no attempt is made to 
 clean the boots etc even for an inspection their buttons arc of the large typo which do not require cleaning 
 the officers are excellently turned out at all times etoglffimt the chasseur who is not an m c e lair 
 cur that is in tho scout company carries a normal pack blankets and an extra pair of boots pull marching 
 order is always worr on route marches and execrcises the officers and sous officor do not carry equipment in peace 
 the bclaireurs or ski ing experts who are the scouts of th a battalion carry only a detachable pack much 
 like the one we cm j in the back woods of canada it is kept off the back by an 
 luminuia brace and is comfortable roomy and efficient it ia at present very popular with skiers and could be described 
 as the normal equipment of a european skier they are also issued with skiing boots and trousers which for six 
 months of the year is their daily dress i might say that after carrying a scout 1 s pool oar 
 own military equipment suffers in comparison but then it i use is for a slightly different purpose i hove incidentall 
 0:incident 0:all bought one of these packs in the simmer months machine guns are carried by mules these mules are 
 not kept by the chasseur personnel but by tunisians who are arabs serving in the french colonial army therf is 
 a battalion of them in chambery and they a e for the mosl part not turned out so well as 
 tho chasseurs nor have tho tho same cheerfulness but it seems they are the only people a na a understands 
 and can get along with they cannot spook french hot tv k arabic j of course a few of the 
 n cosdhave picked uj a bit of french so with that and the bit of arabic tho french officers and 
 h cos have picked up they get along fbey seem rather out of place aaniefet the snows of the op 
 instead of the hot sun of africa 
 146 there are a for rules or cutoms in the popotte that to bo seemed very quaint before you may 
 take a drink from your glass of water beer or rune your neighbour on your left licks his index finger 
 and dips it into your glass you do the same to the man on your right the wqrd rouge is 
 never used in the chasseurs it is forbidden 0:for 0:bidden if you wish to say rouge you must call it 
 bleu cerise this touch would appeal greatly to tho rifle brigade shop is absolutely taboo and a fine box is 
 always in evidence conversation is otherwise unrestricted and the general trend lives up to the boot traditions of any single 
 officer s moss in canada the fact that i was a canadian pleased the frenchmen very much they seem to 
 be almost paternal towards us oven today they have a great interest iir canada and admire the way the canadians 
 helped not england but france in the great tar a brief history 0:hist 0:ory of the chasseurs is attached as 
 an appendix they the 13th were on the western front and fought beside the durham light infantry who had a 
 canadian later on killed as a liason officer the 13th chasseur alpins is a full strength battalion of approximately 850 
 men the of icers are all graduates of st cyr saint maixont or some recognized university the sousofficers 0:sous 0:officers 
 sgts and above have the array as their vocation whilst all the others are thero for two yearsj military service 
 being obligatory in france on reaching the age of twenty if of a certain class one may do one s 
 military service as a reservist officer tho chasseurs pay is 50 centimes a day about two cents he is given 
 all necessaries but not issued vith razor o hence it is not obligatory to shay the chasseur in his ppearanco 
 is not smart or clean by our standard yot he given tho impression of trustworthiness and lcyalty the lads of 
 the chasseurs are all from savole born and bred among the mountains they are willing cheerful and hardworking 0:hard 0:working 
 the sous officers for the most part are from savoie also but the officers naturally come from all over france 
 qjjartfps tho barracks are old and obsolete some having been built in napoleon s time eighteen men to a barrack 
 rooms they have an iron cot like those found in england their kit is lade up neatly but there is 
 no attempt at spit and polish their company and gun stores etc i found very neatly arranged 0:ar 0:ranged and 
 in good repairs there does not ap e r to he any difficulty 0:dif 0:ficulty in obtaining replacements or spare 
 parts the cookhouse is excellent a chief cook who is an ex chasseur and his staff of serving soldiers messing 
 is done by companies each company has its own dining rooms these were fouâ€ž to be very clean and small 
 eatables such as sauce jam etc provided 
 147 arms in this day in europe one is led to believe that arms arc becoming more necessary than iron 
 i have not seen any but the chasseurs alpirrsj boo i is generally conceded that there is not a better 
 type of sold for in prance than these their rifle is the old w in the far there boing no 
 promise of ft new c a t the betadreers enfl machine guns carry a mou squo ton a email rifle 
 of the same bore as toe fusil the mousqueton a is never used at over 200 metres the l a 
 is called a fusil mitrailleuse and in comparison with the br en is an awkward arid complex weapon fixed on 
 a bipod it also has a stand for the butt it is subjected to numerous stoppages and appears to have 
 too many parts the ammunition for this weapon is different from the rifle it is a fair close grouping gun 
 the machine gun cr is the one of the var with no improvement 3 i cannot speak cf its capabilities 
 as i 1 did not see it fired the l a is used on the mountains in winter and is 
 broken into three parts for carrying ytfoat did impress me was their grenades they have two types one for attack 
 and one for defences the one for attack has not such a thick cover and contains less explosives thus it 
 can be thrown in the open the one for defence only from behind cover there is also a grenade which 
 can be fired with a rifle and cup discharger using not ballistite but an ordinary round bayonet sg the rifle 
 or fusil has a long needle like bayonet which is always kept in the scabbard the scabbard is attached to 
 the rifle hen carried the small rifle or mousqueton has another type shorter and broader and is carried in a 
 scabba d on the left hip aspirators the old respirator without a container or haversack was the normal equipment this 
 was carrived in an oval elongated tin that must be very uncomfortable to have rat tling against your leg there 
 are a few of the haversack pattern but efen these have mica eyeshields ana are very uncomfortable to vrcar as 
 to their efficiency i cannot say so much for the arms and equipment of the chausseur alpins the col de 
 hcrvfc cenis in which region i was stationed is 0:stationed 0:is impassable in winter except to expert skiers and movement
