 warrior in his flowing feather bonnet the solitary chipewyan hunter stalking a moose through the frozen muskegs the patient stony
 waiting for a mountain sheep to come within the range of his arrow each of these figures from the past
 could symbolize the variety of life and culture of alberta s indians as the land varied in appearance so did
 the indians vary their lives to meet the demands of nature on the plains where buffalo were found by the
 millions the indians travelled in large bands and after their hunts were over they found time for warfare and ceremonialism
 in the forested regions the indians usually travelled in smaller groups sometimes as single family units hunting moose deer and
 other animals most of their time was spent in the quest for food so there was little time for organized
 societies religious gatherings or warfare the mountain and foothill dwellers found food hard to come by but in some areas
 skirting the plains they often lived upon the buffalo no one knows when the first indians as wood and other
 organic materials came to what is now the province of for weapons and tools even pottery alberta archeologists have found

 known only the buffalo hunt were the new community surrounding them reduced to growing turnips and other language and cultural
 differences often distasteful crops airy tipis were re served to defeat the goal but many placed with dank smoky cabins

 farms and ranches others became commercial fishermen hay contractors or coal miners schools operated by the churches were opened on
 most reserves while large government sponsored industrial institutions were opened near h i g h river calgary and red deer
 by 1900 alberta s indians seemed well on the way to making reasonable adjustment to their new way of life
 however when the age of mechanization arrived during the early part of the century the already noticeable gap between indian
 and non indian widened the horse was no longer the centre of farm life and the indians trained in outdated
 methods found their place limited in the fast paced technical world motor vehicles wiped out their profitable freighting businesses expensive
 mechanical equipment was required in farming and education was required in almost every field soon the indian again was a
 stranger in his own land some people believed that he was the vanishing american who could never adapt to the
 new life and would gradually disappear certainly the mortality rate was abnormally h i g h for many years and
 opportunities for education or employment were meagre the second world war marked the major c h a n g e
 in this picture this change was not only among the indians but also in the attitude of canadian towards the
 native peoples gradually improved educational facilities health services and other services have begun to show beneficial results mechanization on indian
 reserves has progressed to a point where work horses have become a rarity and higher e d u c a

 was taken by t george anderton a north west mounted policeman at fort walsh in about 1879 brought more and
 more indians into professional or technical positions they have wrought many changes in their lives in the course of a
 few generations but the transition has not been easy it has been filled with bitterness confusion and heartache to many
 the battle is won for others difficult years lie ahead as they take their place in the new society some
 account of the cree and other indians 1819 by robert hood note robert hood the author of this narrative was
 a member of sir john franklin s first exploring expedition 1819 21 he was appointed admiralty midshipman to the expedition
 in london and arrived at york factory on august 30 1819 from there the expedition went to cumberland house where
 it remained for several months during that time lieut hood made rough notes and observations about the indians animal life
 weather and other features of the north west he also made a trip to the area east of nipawin sask
 to study life away from a trading post in the spring of 1820 the expedition went north via portage la
 loche and fort chipewyan eventually reaching the arctic ocean in doing so they bypassed the mackenzie river in favor of
 a more difficult route farther east they built fort enterprize on snare lake and it was there that lieut hood
 compiled his notes into a journal in april 1821 about six months later on october 20 th he was murdered
 by an indian guide during a period of starvation lieut hood s notes are a valuable addition to the ethnography
 of the cree and neighboring tribes while a certain christian bias is shown towards native religion and attitudes are judged
 by european standards the journal contains many significant statements based upon personal observation although his notes were made at cumberland
 house in north eastern saskatchewan the culture he describes was common to the woodland crees throughout the three western provinces

 so i guess time as cst biggs and another mountie he wanted to get some ideas from them cst biggs
 was a brave man and was while they were in calgary going to go right into the house but cashel
 was in there and took a shot after he was finished i drove him at biggs the bullet striking the
 heel of home again it was dark when we got his boot then the police got a bunch to the
 school i let him off at his resi of wood and piled it by the house and dence and drove
 on to the stables farther threatened to burn him out when he on when i got there i unhitched the
 didn t surrender they set fire to the horses and took their harness off the wood but kept it away
 from the house stable had big doors in front for the the smoke was drawn down into the horses and
 other doors in the back for house and cashel thought the place pitching out manure as i opened the was
 on fire so he gave up he was exedoor i heard somebody go through the cuted later in the year
 back door and close it behind him that was how close i came to meet luckily the stable boys had
 filled the ing cashel there was a reward for his manger with hay so i just had to turn capture
 and if rev hogbin had gone the horses loose in the stable and was right out and reported my information
 able to run away fast to the police we might have gotten it as it was no reward was given

 an educated metis in the late 1890 s little is known about the author but his tales are significant in
 that they reflect some of the commonplace events in the life of an indian camp the daring raid won back
 all that had been lost but had won everything from the opposite party white eye was a blackfoot brave who
 used to make raids into the cypress he then jumped up and left as sud hills country for the purpose
 of getting denly as he had appeared leaving the ponies and scalps that he was a daring gamblers to go
 on with the game or to horse thief the following incident will quarrel over the winnings his first move show
 a very fast horse had been stolen was to find the horse this he soon acfrom his chief the chief
 was very sorry complished he found it in a little lodge about the loss and made many offers adjoining the
 one that its owner lived of reward to his young men if they in he entered as noiselessly as possible
 would recover the stolen animal one bridled the horse put his blanket on for day white eye said that he
 would a saddle and before leading the horse bring the horse back to camp of course out he turned to
 the keeper of the horse nobody believed he would such a horse aroused him and said white eye is would
 be well guarded day and night taking your horse to return him to the wherever it was man he was
 stolen from if you want him you need a faster one to overtake me white eye reasoned that the greater
 i am off the next moment the fast horse the feat the greater the honor and set galloped out of
 the camp with white out to perform his self imposed task eye on his back after wandering about till he
 had worn this warrior next made his appearout many a pair of moccasins he dis once in a half breed
 camp near crane covered the camp in which the horse lake the following is the story told by was kept
 he loitered about the camp one of the hunters we were camped unseen till everybody excepting some near crane lake
 making pemmican and gamblers had gone to bed still the dried meat we as usual had made a noise of
 the tom tom and singing of the large corral of our carts every night gamblers kept up as white eye
 could we put our horses into this enclosure talk cree he resolved to go into the our tepees stood on
 the outside of this gambler s t e p e e trusting that they would mistake him for a cree
 ring as it was called and a guard of twelve men were stationed outside of so in he went and
 took a seat with the circle of lodges with all these prethe gamblers he was not long seated cautions why
 should not people sleep till he saw that the party on his side soundly of the lodge were losing they
 were i can show that they did sleep soundplaying the well known game of hiding ly the first thing that
 woke them was something in the hand and challenging the galloping of a horse one man not the opposite party
 to guess which hand as fast asleep as the others heard the it was in when it came to his
 turn to noise and woke his companion up these do the guessing he turned the luck at two men rushed
 out of the hut and were once he guessed right every time and met by a strange horse caparisoned in
 long before daylight he had not only genuine blackfoot style in a few mo 25 ments all was noise and
 bustle the late one night the head men met in captain of the guard was up and on council but
 did not come to a decision making his rounds found one of his men about moving the camp till everyone
 sound asleep with a shot gun in his else had gone to sleep their resolve arms the gun did not
 belong to any one was that the camp should be moved and in camp when the horses in the ring
 in view of the temperate state of the were counted it was found that seven weather and in the interests
 of cleanliof the best were missing ness very prompt action was decided some y e a r s after this
 happened upon very early next morning before there was any stir about the camp the white eye on visiting the
 half breed camp told how he had found the sentinel camp crier was sent out making the asleep and put
 his own gun in his arms round of the tepees crying the camp for a joke and had opened the
 corral must be moved this morning the young and taken seven of their best horses men must not go to
 hunt or to set their traps till the camp is moved and pitched i may mention before closing that in
 on the opposite side of the creek dians on the war path never carried long guns they shortened them by
 cut on hearing this rather unexpected ting the stock down to about ten inches order from the council there was
 an imand the barrel to about twelve these mediate commotion in the camp and s h o r t guns
 they carried under their everything was wide awake and astir blankets and you never could tell they in a moment
 or two there was a general were armed inclination on the part of the people to obey the orders from
 the council as pro claimed by the crier moving the camp in a short time every tepee was down and
 being packed up in preparation for this incident which i am about to moving but one this one belonged to

 ago it was be other and younger wife in the first part fore the days of indian treaties at the
 of the winter he the husband with his time when the dwellers of the plains young wife lived alongside wife
 no 1 lived within their tribal customs and in a tepee of their own when he saw when the word
 of the head man or that his wife no 1 had not pulled her chief was the supreme law among
 the tepee down he insisted on her taking members of the tribe it down right away this she refused to
 at the time of which i write we were do but her husband stood over her with camped in the
 shelter of the timber on a gun in his hand and gave her to una little stream that empties into
 the red derstand that she must pull the tepee deer river the winter had been a fine down without further
 delay and prepare one and buffalo were near and numer to shift camp along with the rest of the ous
 all winter thousands of buffalo tribe it will be noticed that the work robes had been dressed and thousands as
 was the indian custom was put upon of hides made into moccasins and tent the women to do leather wolves
 and foxes had been kil when she saw there was no other led by hundreds course open for her she
 went to work when the thaw set in at springtime to pack up her stuff and pull the tepee our
 camp presented a frightful appear down the tepee she rolled up and put once carcasses that had been snowed on
 the pony with the pots and kettles on under now came in sight scraps of meat the top the tepee
 poles she tied in two clippings of hide and tufts of hair lay bundles and slung to the pack saddle
 round everywhere everybody wished so that the pony could drag them when to leave the winter camp ground and get
 all this was done she still had a large to some cleaner and nicer spot but ac bundle to carry
 this she knelt down cording to the tribal customs nothing in front of and put the strap that was could
 be done without the consent of the attached to it on her head and rose up council with the pack
 on her back and followed 26 a cree indian camp her pony her husband followed at her husband standing waist
 deep in the heels swift running water found the whole just as they were reaching the creek situation so ludicrous
 that he almost let her husband noticed that the pack on the living contents of the bundle drown the pony
 was slipping off to one side before he made an effort at rescuing the and as his wife was nearer
 to the pony fast tied bundle by this time the bundle than he was he called to her to drop
 was a struggling mass of lively househer load and attend to the pony for fear hold effects everything should get
 wet she accord it turned out that this woman with ingly dropped her load on the bank and the example
 of her husband to guide her ran to the pony which had now reached had thought that two could play
 at the the creek before she could right his load game if her husband could take anshe was waist deep
 in the creek so she other wife into his home she could also hung to the pony till he reached
 the receive the attentions of another swain opposite bank this man who in her devotion she had when she looked
 back she saw that bundled up and packed on her back her lord and master had taken up the was
 her sweetheart on this visit he pack she had dropped and was midway had lingered rather longer than usual in
 the stream with it on his back while and had not yet departed when the procshe was thus taking in
 the situation lamation of the crier had aroused the her husband looked up and saw his wife camp so suddenly
 that he could not watching him as he bore the burden leave the lodge without running chances upon his back
 in mid stream no doubt of detection we have heard of small by this time the reasons for her reluct
 men who have hidden away in various ance at pulling down her tent on such places but this particular brave
 was a short notice had dawned upon his mind tall strapping fellow and he had taken a tumble so while
 the wife stood on the bank of the creek looking at him he deliberately threw baiting a bear the pack
 into the deepest part of the in the 1850 s an indian war party stream might be met with at
 any moment and when the wife saw this her reserve prairie travellers had to constantly be departed and she yelled
 to her husband on the w a t c h night and day these he ll drown pull him out

 to run away but by this time expecting every day to find a camp of the whole party had surrounded
 the lake blackfeet but no camp could be found and prevented the bear from making its i may mention here
 that the man that escape they kept the bear running till discovered a camp of the enemy was re it
 was fairly played out it then lay warded for it by being allowed to wear down and put its paw
 over its wounded a wolf skin tied to his heel this was eye and groaned of course considered a great
 honor and at this they all laughed and thought many a young brave would run himself it great fun to
 torment the bear while to death to gain the distinction it was lying with its paw over its eye at
 medicine hat they discovered crooked foot one of the three young some fresh signs and each one resolved men that
 found the bear volunteered to find the camp they accordingly scat to go up and stab it his companions adtered
 out while running round and spy vised him not to attempt it but he was ing in every direction they
 were sur determined to do something to s h o w prised by a small war party and had to

 on tip toe with his knife morning they turned their steps east in his outstretched hand his companions ward knowing
 that it would be useless waited in breathless silence to see the to try to get ponies or scalps now
 that knife plunge into the bear but just as their enemies knew they were in the the knife came down
 the bear jumped vicinity all their bright hopes had van up and made a grasp for the man it ished
 and the stern reality of having to would no doubt have got him if it had foot it back to
 their camp stared them in had the use of both its eyes as it was the face it made things
