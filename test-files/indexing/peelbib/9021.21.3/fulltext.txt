 1958 return postage guaranteed the rebellion at lac la biche by evelyn rowand although the most dramatic events of the
 rid rebellion apart from the frog lake massacre occurred in what is now the province of saskatchewan the north eastern
 part of alberta also had its share of alarms and excitement one of the men who was a witness to
 these events was peter erasmus an educated mixed blood who lived at whitefish lake another was bishop faraud of the
 oblate order whose episcopal seat was in lac ia biche then an entrepot for provisioning the roman catholic missions of
 the north erasmus was born in fort garry in 1833 earlier been granted the grant of a horse became a
 school teacher at the age of 15 harness and wagon to each chief and a few and spent three years
 studying for the agricultural tools meant little to the nomad anglican ministry he then acted as in ic plains crees
 nor did the grant of 1 000 terpreter for methodist minister thomas for three years to purchase provisions to woolsey
 was foreman of the crew and in those who actively engaged in agriculture terpreter for the palliser expedition tried tempt
 men who had not the slightest knowhis hand at mining in the rockies and trap ledge of how to farm
 nor the desire to do ping in the north was interpreter and indian so the provision of a medicine chest
 for agent and finally was a trader at white the band and the provision of aid and rafish lake the
 scope of his activities in tions in the event of any pestilence or genaddition to his own intelligence and educa
 eral famine were a little more comforting tion gave erasmus a thorough understand indeed the minister of the interior feared
 ing of the west its people and problems lest such generosity should lead to loss of initiative and excessive dependence
 on the after the red river rebellion of 1869 government the indians were anxious to find out the intentions of
 the canadian government to a few chiefs remained recalcitrant and wards them the buffalo were almost gone would not sign
 poundmaker eventually and the rumour that they were no longer gave in grudgingly the chiefs at pitt deto be allowed
 to roam at will gave rise to dared that if their brothers at canton were worry and unrest in his
 report for 1871 2 satisfied so were they erasmus urged them rev peter campbell at victoria mission re to state
 their objections if they had any marked that the whites in the area were before they signed the treaty because
 afterfearful because there was no treaty he wards they must be prepared to live up to tween the government and
 the indians not its terms chief pakan james seenurn of until the summer of 1876 did negotiations whitefish lake complained
 that the land actually get under way in march of that alloted him was not nearly sufficient for the year
 erasmus received a letter from big needs of his people to which the governor child and star blanket two important
 replied that he could do nothing about the chiefs of the plains crees asking him to be apportionment of land
 but would pass their interpreter treaty 6 was signed at pakan s objections on to his superiors he fort carlton
 august 23 and at fort pitt was sure that the chief s request would not on september 9 be granted
 however since it would be unfair to the other chiefs erasmus interpreted the treaty discussed its terms and sounded opinion
 endlessly at ‘ the story of peter erasmus hqs been taken from an unpublished manuscript which is carlton the indians
 voiced many objections hopefully soon to be published it is availand obtained more generous terms than had able at the
 glenbow archives in calgary mrs rowand is a resident of edmonton who received her ma in history from the university
 of alberta and a ph d in african history from the university of birmingham england she is preparing a history
 on the lac la biche area 1 erasmus was satisfied that the chiefs in the winter of 1881 erasmus was
 sent had understood the document they signed to the cypress hills to try to persuade the and would live up
 to its terms he was plains cree malcontents to go to their retherefore astounded to learn on the return serves
 a few of the eastern bands consentjourney from a member of pakan s own ed to go home and big
 bear went to the band william bull that pakan believed reserve he had chosen at frog lake but that he
 had been promised the land he asked others refused to budge at this time for bull said that he and
 all the others erasmus left the employ of the indian knew better and had tried to reason with agency in
 edmonton and returned to him but he only grew angry with them whitefish lake where he went into trade bull
 foresaw trouble in the future because first for himself and then as agent for the his people would naturally believe
 pakan hudson s bay co erasmus thought that the treaties were pakan was still unhappy about the generous and that
 the government although amount of land alloted him and persuaded dilatory and often ill informed was acting erasmus to go
 with him to regina in june in good faith at that time pakan s band 1884 to see the lieutenant
 governor and was better off than most as one of the sub get the boundaries extended they based chiefs little
 hunter remarked their claim on the fact that the promise of 80 acres for each man woman and child poundmaker
 is not satisfiednor will could not be fulfilled in the existing circumhe ever be satisfied he does not stances they
 were successful but not to think but just talks and keeps on the extent that pakan wished he was also
 talking he and some of the others unhappy about the fact that the promise will make trouble times will be
 hard for the prairie indians once the buf was verbal and he had nothing in writing falo are gone they
 will have nothing the extension was barred to settlement but and will not settle on the land until up until
 the time of the rebellion he had they are nearing starvation stein received no official notification that the hauer has
 often told us that we must learn to farm and raise animals to lieutenant governor s promise would be support
 ourselves for the day when carried out the buffalo will be no more now i have to believe him we
 are lucky to all appearances life in the remote that we already know something settlements of victoria lac ia biche
 and about raising grain and vegetables and besides we still have bush game whitefish lake continued to pursue its and
 fish accustomed and untroubled way erasmus was therefore not a little surprised in march the whitefish lake mission was unique
 1885 when a friend came to warn the because it was entirely in native hands on whitefish people that fighting
 had broken which account it both suffered and flourish out at batoche and riel claimed a victory ed steinhauer was
 never able to get the against the police big bear had also enterfinancial help the parent society granted ed the
 fray and it was reported that his the white missionaries and so the people men had killed two priests and
 several were forced to help themselves mission and other whites at frog lake some of the school were built by
 them at no expense saddle lake people had also decided to to the methodists indeed most of the help join
 in the fighting and were planning to they received came from christie of the attack victoria it was known that
 the hudson s bay company who gave them rebels planned to take possession of all a plow and contributed generously
 to the hudson s bay posts salary of a teacher when help was not forthcoming from the society when their
 pakan received the news without sunponies refused to haul the plow the indians prise even with indifference and erasmus pulled
 it themselves they used roots for wondered if his dissatisfaction over his hoes at fort pitt pakan expressed his dealings
 with the government had anything gratitude that henceforth they would have to do with his attitude all agreed that proper
 implements for working the land after victoria erasmus s post would be the there were loyal metis prepared to pro
 tect the post and the mission but they could not do so without ammunition young 4 left the post in
 charge of peachy pruden who was also responsible for moving young s family his own and the depend ents of
 the post to a place of safety somewhere around the lake erasmus and young set out forthwith stopping at whitefish
 where young gave pakan a stiff lecture about keeping his people from joining the rebels in edmonton they saw general
 t bland strange and obtained a supply of ammunition and a few guns young also got a supply of food
 with which to pacify the indians but his freighters having heard of i the frog lake massacre and the fall
 of fort pitt refused to go north erasmus and young therefore returned alone by way of victoria they found the
 place deserted until rev mclaughlin put in a cautious appearance he told them that all the settlers from victoria to
 lobstick had camped across the river some rebels from saddle lake had tried to raid the fort but the single
 guard within had ‘ bluffed them and scared them off the an important figure in the events of the minister
 asked if he might join young and riel rebellion in north eastern alberta was peter erasmus at left with him
 is erasmus for he was disturbed as to the rev mr day a methodist minister whereabouts of a school teacher
 the only other white man in the area first target in order that the rebels might obtain ammunition and plunder
 to induce the weather was miserable and erasmus members of pakan band to join them was vastly annoyed at mclaughlin
 who ironically erasmus had very little animuni apparently trusted in the almighty to protion and it was agreed that he
 should go vide the necessary food and clothing when to lac ia biche to obtain more he started being no
 stranger to the country and having off before daylight and arrived early in the an ample supply of both he
 ought to have afternoon provided for himself as it was they had to share the last of their scanty rations
 with harrison young the hudson s bay him it was necessary to proceed with cmtrader at lac ia biche was
 considerably cumspection for there was no way of knowupset when told about the rebellion especi ing where the enemy might
 be lurking ally in view of the fact that there had been erasmus was annoyed once again when a surprisingly
 heavy run on powder and after a scouting tour he heard shots and balls for the previous few weeks and
 he sped back to find it was his own companhad no ammunition left he set off for the ions indulging
 in a shooting contest catholic mission seven miles away but found that they had already been warned upon reaching whitefish
 lake they and were busy evacuating their people found the settlement deserted and not a young and erasmus decided that
 there was scrap of food to be had erasmus noticed at least a chance that they might get to a
 fresh grave and surmised that there had edmonton and back with supplies of am been a killing he surmised also
 that his munition before big bear s men could come adopted soii peter shirt would take his 3 family and
 those who wished to follow him to join them in raiding the fort it they reto victoria shirt had had
 a dream that all fused they would be shot the men claimed this would come to pass and that he
 must that they had sent a boy to warn peachy deliver the people safely to victoria where and pot pruden
 the guardians of the fort they would find soldiers to protect them while questioning his son s rationale after disarming
 the men and promising erasmus had no doubt of his intentions to leave their guns on the other side of
 the nor of his ability and managed to find the river erasmus and young warned that circuitous route the party
 was taking in soldiers and police were on the way any order to reach their destination in safety indian caught
 off his reserve would be shot on sight this was of course not true for erasmus was informed that a
 number of general strange had no intentions of send big bear s men led by one cardinal had ing troops
 to so remote a post when the come to whitefish to get the band to join need for them was
 so great elsewhere the the rebellion pakan was non committal ruse worked however for erasmus had the sitting on the
 fence but shirt argued satisfaction of watching the men break camp strongly against such a dangerous move without touching their
 meal and riding at and many agreed with him cardinal was a fast gallop on the direct road to beaver
 gaining support and perhaps confidence lake for he suddenly lost patience and ordered shirt to hand over the hudson s
 bay s upon arrival at lac la biche they found goods when shirt refused the man began the store a
 shambles but young was pleased to help himself suddenly cootsoo who to find that the books were still intact had
 done nothing during the proceedings erasmus says that young s house had not except to nod agreement with shirt shot
 been touched although his pet dog had been cardinal through the heart and ordered the cruelly butchered which sent him
 into a other interlopers off the reserve on pain of kind of frenzy that worried his companion similar treatment young
 was anxious for news of his lam pakan was furious and ordered his im ily and the two set out
 at once for the mispulsive subject never to show his face among sion calling at the home of a man
 named them again the die had been cast for him umla on the way one wonders if this was not
 only would he be faced with fierce not in fact alex hamelin the only mdcretaliation from big bear but the
 dead pendent trader then in the area at any man s relatives were also certain to seek rate the visit
 turned out to be a mistake revenge cootsoo s many friends were also for six of the beaver lake raiders
 were in annoyed with pakan convinced that his the store and were not in a friendly mood intentions had been
 responsible for this dis umla and erasmus tried to bluff them astrous turn of affairs his people would umla asking
 what news he brought from listen only to peter shirt and gladly did his edmonton and erasmus repeating the bidding
 story he had told their kinsmen a few hours before suddenly one of the crees whipped young advised those at
 whitefish lake up his gun and pointed it towards young that if they were short of food they should who
 was standing beside erasmus the kill their beef animals and he would reini latter reacted swiftly and knocked the gun
 burse them erasmus distributed arms and aside only then did he realize that young ammunition and the two continued on
 to had provoked the action by training his lac la biche young did not trust the weapon upon the men
 a foolhardy move beaver lake crees and a close look out was in view of the fact that they were
 armed kept on the way they came across two with hatchets and knives as well as guns crees cooking their
 dinner and drying two and were skilled in the use of all three new hudson s bay blankets obviously from
 and there were six of them young inthe stock at young s post they confessed sisted that the men be
 disarmed and ulma that big bear s men had conic to the re after warning them that the bay man
 had serve and forced the beaver lake people the legal right to shoot them because they some indication of the
 type of people in the lac la biche area can be seen in this illustration drawn by frederic remington ten
 years after the rebellion it shows families coming to the settlement to celebrate new years were wearing clothing stolen from
 his own young found his family safe and well store persuaded them to give him their erasmus returned with the
 horses to ulma s guns until tenipers had cooled the crees where he ran the gauntlet of another over sullenly
 complied and went off in single zealous guard file as if on the war path after a night s rest
 erasmus set off to after chiding young for his rash action find peter shirt and his own family which when
 he and erasmus had the situation lie did with little difficulty four days later well in hand by diplomatic means
 umla the party pitched canip close to where the warned him that he feared for his safety town of smoky
 lake is situated today a once he left the store the crees could scouting party set out to see what
 the situeasily obtain other weapons and trail him ation was at victoria ten miles distant there was no use going
 to the mission cautiously searching out a safe viewpoint only bishop faraud and one priest remain the scouts looked down
 at the fort and ed there guarded by loyal metis young s niission in the valley below and beheld a
 family was across the lake at the mouth busy army encampment as peter shirt of the lac la biche river
 and intended to had known they would proceed by canoe to athabasca landing umla would lend them fresh horses and
 the foregoing was peter erasmus s versif they hurried hey might overtake the ion of the rebellion in the north
 east now party before they left erasmus had intend let us hear what bishop faraud had to say ed to
 rejoin his own party but agreed to we have seen that according to erasmus accompany young in order to return
 the young had no inkling that trouble was horses near at hand this seenis to be confirmed by a letter
 from faraud to the superior umla was not as confident as he sound general on june 6 1885 ed for
 he confided to erasnius that he feared lest the raiders had followed pruden and on april 17 th we had
 no intimation killed them all they found the party well of any thing untoward coming about three in the evening
 mr young the guarded however and erasmus was glad hudson s bay company agent and that he was in young
 s conipany when a justice of the peace came with four loyal metis suddenly appeared from behind people pakan cree
 chief of a bush with his gun trained on them after white fish lake mr stennor steinhauer presbyterian methodist mmrecognizing

 resolutions stiffened but they the two priests was the tibias of two were few and alone pressed to go imlegs

 consequences for himself and day taking advantage of the respite to the whites pakan returned an unequivocal warn pruden refusal

 that one detach scattered them to the winds the women inent would guard the roads to the fort and tore

 remarkable may have been a bit hazy in spots on the other hand he was an active participant in all
 the events he describes he was not a braggart and told many a tale at his own expense his narrative
 gives the iiiipression of being an honest and straight forward account of events as he saw them it was strange
 that harrison younf claimed that he made the dangerous trip tc edmonton and back alone erasmus s de tailed account
 of their journey has a definite ring of truth about it bishop faraud say 5 that erasmus pakan and steinhauer
 came to the mission but erasmus claims thai pakan stayed with his people he makes nc mention of having gone

 the accussors as early as march 1887 as for hinchliffe s busy working on the buildings at the mis knowledge
 of blackfoot it was slight sion or working at his books he was on the second day of the commission
 charged with purchasing moccasins on sun hinchliffe possibly seeing his previous day but the indians agreed that trivett while taking
 thenu on a sunday had paid charges going down the drain filed three additional charges he accused trivett of for
 them another day he was accused of working on sunday but it turned out he lying to white people other
 than hinchliffe was removing door hinges when a door being profamie and being careless in spendwouldn t open trivett was
 charged by ing c m s funds these charges were not substantiated but it is sadly amusing to look hinchliffe
 as being dishonest but when he at the charge of profanity couldn t prove this charge he wanted it to
 stand anyway miss barker testified she had heard trivett say damiin it while trying to hang trivett was charged as
 being incapable of giving religious instructiomi to the indians presumably a reference to his lack of evidence given before the

 his inability in the then oiie of hinchliffe s star witnesses language and his lack of responsibility in carrying out
 the required worship services miss barker did an about face hinchliffe in his location on the reserve the bishop quoted
 her as hearing trivett tell lies to was not hesitant about laying it on the line other whites later in
 the investigation miss barker said in appointing the commission i felt how much amusement we were i have not heard
