 the patrician 5 exercise nahanni mm captain pa maione 2 ppcli in january of 1963 during the initial planning for 
 exercise nahanni i it was suggested that an unnamed mountain be selected in the nahanni area and that it be 
 named after our founder brigadier a hamilton gault dso ed cd this was deemed to be an excellent project for 
 jubilee year and this proposal was submitted to ottawa for approval we were advised that double names could not be 
 approved this eliminated our original choice of mount hamilton gault however we were informed that the name mount gault could 
 be considered one of the aims of exercise nahanni i was to select a suitable peak in the area this 
 aim was accomplished and planning immediately began on exercise nahanni 11 a party of seven members of 2 ppcli were 
 given the task of climbing the mountain erecting a cairn and naming the mountain this task was to be completed 
 during our jubilee year and a target date of 30 sep 64 was set for the return of the party 
 i consider myself extremely fortunate to have been selected to command the party the first step in preparation for exercise 
 nahanni ii was to formulate 0:formu 0:late an outline plan for submission to army headquarters for approval as an adventure 
 training exercise after considerable map and air photo study and invaluable recommendations from capt fl berry who commanded 0:com 0:manded 
 exercise nahanni i the following plan was evolved the party would consist of seven men with two large river boats 
 and two small punts all provisions equipment and fuel with the exception 0:excep 0:tion of a cache of fuel for 
 the return trip would be carried with the party the fuel for the return trip would be snipped by barge 
 from fort nelson to nahanni butte after the 1964 spring breakup the party would proceed 0:pro 0:ceed by road from 
 hamilton gault barracks edmonton to fort nelson 8 c a distance of some 750 miles by boat down the fort 
 nelson river to the liard river and down the liard to the junction of the liard and nahanni rivers a 
 distance of 300 miles and a further 140 miles up the nahanni to bring us to virginia falls the limit 
 of travel with the two large boats the two small punts and sufficient supplies would be portaged 0:port 0:aged around 
 the falls and the party would continue up the nahanni another 0:an 0:other 100 miles to a point directly north 
 of the proposed hamilton gault mountain the mountain would be assaulted from this position and the party would return by 
 the same route this plan would necessitate the building of one large river boat two smaller flat bottomed punts and 
 repairing the boat used in exercise nahanni i we would also have to acquire a minimum of two outboard motors 
 which could be used on the punts as well as the two larger boats army headquarters approved the plan in 
 full including a sum of 500 00 for materials to build the boats two 35 hp mercury motors were purchased 
 by the battalion and all that was left to be done w s recruit the rest of the team build 
 the boats and assemble stores 
 the patrician 6 response to a call for volunteers was good and by devious means i selected the following personnel 
 cpl rr lewis lcpls j dalton fj huard and raj peskett and pte we brown public relations could not provide 
 a cameraman so a civilian mr sigfried bucher who was enthusiastic 0:en 0:thusiastic enough to relinquish any claim against the 
 crown for damages 0:da 0:mages to his person was also recruited with the technical aid of the unit pioneer trades 
 section and a set of plans we started manufacturing one can imagine the many moments of near despair that were 
 endured by this crew which had never built a boat the army supply system in its own way helped matters 
 by producing 0:pro 0:ducing materials starting from the wrong end of the list we had paint and fibreglas cloth two 
 weeks before the lumber and screws this all somehow sorted itself out and in a month and a half the 
 boats were built the exercise nahanni i boat a 27 footer had been named the admiral 0:ad 0:miral ramsay the 
 previous year and we considered it fitting to name our new 32 foot the hamilton gault this christening was performed 
 in fitting naval manner by breaking a bottle of champagne on her bow the two 18 foot punts were relegated 
 mere registration numbers the transport of this flotilla by vehicle to fort nelson was another problem in that there seemed 
 no wav of transporting a 32 foot boat on a 12 foot 2v2 ton truck box the nahanni i crew 
 solved this problem by building a 10 foot extension onto the back of the truck and we strengthened this frame 
 to accommodate our greater load needless to say the presence of so many boats in an army establishment 0:establish 0:ment 
 induced a normal amount of comment from the local critics the least of these was to call us the ppcli 
 navy i for one was relieved when final preparations were completed in late august and the exercise was about to 
 begin we departed hamilton gault barracks at 0710 hrs 01 aug 64 the road move to fort nelson bc was 
 conducted without incident although there had recently been a great deal of rain and washouts were numerous 0:num 0:erous on 
 the unnaved portions of the alaska highway very little delay was encountered on arrival at fort nelson at approximately 1800 
 hrs 02 aug we commenced offloading the vehicles at the barge landing on the fort nelson river opposite old fort 
 nelson by 2000 hrs most of the unloading was completed and our first riverside camp set up next morning the 
 boats were loaded and arrangements were made to leave our vehicles with the department of public works in muskwa about 
 5 miles south of fort nelson final load adjustments were made and the river journey started at 1500 hrs the 
 fort nelson river according to local inhabitants was up seven or eight feet above its normal level for that time 
 of year it soon became evident that the admiral ramsay was greatly overloaded and that navigation would be perillous even 
 downstream although it would neces 
 the patrician sitate a change of plan i decided that the 18 foot punt carried on this boat would have 
 to be cached as all other equipment was vital to the exercise rather than making one trip with two 18 
 foot punts from virginia falls to the base of hamilton gault mountain we would have to run a shuttle service 
 after caching the punt on an island approximately 18 miles down the river from our start point we continued our 
 journey for the remainder 0:re 0:mainder of the day without much difficulty it should be noted that although we did 
 not have any serious mishap both boats were still overloaded 0:over 0:loaded and it is not advisable to travel a 
 river in such circumstances we were not to realize fully how much unnecessary equipment we were carrying and the hazardous 
 effects of overloading until later in the trip at 1945 hrs on 04 aug we arrived at fort liard where 
 we contacted 0:con 0:tacted the rcmp the last post on our route and spent the night next day we continued 
 to nahanni butte topped up with fuel from the supply shipped in earlier and prepared to continue up the nahanni 
 our plan was discussed with mr dick turner the local trading post operator who gave us much sound advice it 
 appeared that although the fort nelson and liard rivers were in flood the nahanni was not and we would have 
 favourable water conditions mr turner owns and operates his own float aircraft and we arranged 0:ar 0:ranged to leave one 
 of our two 510 sets with him for ground to air communication in the event that this was required with 
 all arrangements 0:arrange 0:ments completed we commenced our upriver journey on the morning of 06 aug for the first 10 
 miles or so the nahanni is quite slow and easy one then encounters the splits the name given to the 
 maze of tributaries 0:tri 0:butaries or snyes on the river as it comes out of the first canyon the difficulty 
 in this section of the river is choosing the snye with sufficient depth of water in which to navigate although 
 one becomes quite adept at this water reading even the experts occasionally make miscalculations and have to backtrack and try 
 another channel we were fortunate and did not have to do this often but the water became increasingly 0:in 0:creasingly 
 fast as we approached the top of the splits and the overloaded 0:over 0:loaded condition of our boats made progress 
 very slow but progress we did and arrived at the first hot springs at about 1800 hrs on 07 aug 
 we stopped for an hour or so at the hot springs to eat change the propellor on the admiral ramsay 
 and adjust the load on the hamilton gault so that the bow would come further out of the water during 
 this interlude we talked with mr gus kraus who lives with his family at the hot springs the last point 
 of permanent habitation on the nahanni we gained a good deal of information concerning the next stretch of river from 
 mr kraus who has been a resident of the area since the late 19205 as there were still a few 
 hours of daylight left we continued upriver 0:up 0:river the hamilton gault handled much better with the changed loading and 
 we navigated lafferty s riffle the first bit of acknowledged 7 
 the patrician 8 bad water without difficulty we camped that night at the spray a very cold flow of water 
 which bursts from an underground source and cascades down the canyon wall into the nahanni this is located about 3 
 miles up the first canyon although it is only about 15 miles from the spray to the top of the 
 first canyon and into deadman s valley late afternoon of the next day found us just coming up to george 
 s riffle having covered a distance 0:dis 0:tance of little more than 12 miles the river current had increased and 
 progress was so slow that i decided we must lighten our load prior to carrying on from deadman s valley 
 as it turned out this was proven to be an unnecessary action george s riffle is a stretch of fast 
 water which sweeps down the side of a canyon wall takes almost a right angle turn is deflected from the 
 opposite canyon wall and continues down river in a straight heavy flow the only feasible route through the riffle is 
 along the right hand side close to the canyon wall and just out of the large rollers of the riffle 
 we had been told that there was a large rock somewhere in the middle of this route but we could 
 not see it because the water was high from recent rainfall i took the hamilton gault through first we hit 
 the submerged rock a glancing blow suffered no damage and continued through without 0:with 0:out further incident we took the 
 boat ashore about 300 yards above the main riffle so that we could take pictures and direct the other boat 
 through the landing spot had very little drop off but was the best at hand and i had no intention 
 of bringing the other boat in there i waved the admiral ramsay to start through and to all outward appearances 
 it made it nicely but as it drew alongside our position they indicated that the boat had taken a lot 
 of water aboard and had hit the submerged rock quite hard there was nothing to do but allow them to 
 come in alongside the other boat we bailed out and waited for awhile to determine from water intake if the 
 boat had been holed it did not appear to be taking water quickly if at all so we decided to 
 push on the remaining 2 or 3 miles to deadman valley where we had planned to stop for 2 days 
 and to effect any necessary 0:neces 0:sary repairs there in order to get enough depth of water to use the 
 motor we had to hold the boat out about 10 feet from shore when the motor was started and running 
 we pushed the boat out so that it would clear any rocks in the shallows when throttle was applied it 
 became immediately evident that although the motor was operating no thrust was produced we later deduced 0:de 0:duced that the 
 propellor drive shaft had been cracked by an earlier rock strike and had picked this inopportune moment to break off 
 completely it was impossible for those of us standing by to get near enough to catch the boat as it 
 was by this time in deep water the current caught it and they proceeded back down through george s riffle 
 at one point when they came within about 20 feet of shore cpl lewis jumped out with bow line in 
 an attempt to reach shore and perhaps bring the boat in the water 
 the patrician 9 was too deep and swift to allow this and he had to drop the line in order 
 to get to shore himself the boat with its two occupants continued down through the main riffle it appeared that 
 the boat was going to keep straight and ride the riffle through but suddenly a current turned it sideways 0:side 
 0:ways it quickly filled with water and was overturned by a large wave the crew were thrown out but managed 
 to get back to the boat and hang on once a course of action could be established i launched the 
 other boat and proceeded to attempt a rescue we tried to get the swamped crew boat and all out of 
 the main current after several unsuccessful attempts we had to get the crew out of the water and abandon the 
 boat until we could get them ashore and cared for with this done we continued in our attempts to salvage 
 the boat and any other items broken loose from their lashings and floating about the river in this area runs 
 swiftly with very few areas of backwater or decreased current for about 15 miles we found it impossible to manoeuvre 
 0:man 0:oeuvre the swamped boat and get it to shore as evening was approaching 0:approach 0:ing i discontinued the salvage 
 attempts because we had proceeded several miles downstream and would be a considerable time getting back to those we had 
 left ashore we went ashore quickly unloaded the hamilton gault left two men to make camp and went back to 
 recover those we had put ashore earlier by the time we had returned to the camp it was dark it 
 would have been foolhardy to have continued salvage attempts any longer as it would be extremely hazardous to attempt navigating 
 the river in darkness the following morning morale was low it appeared that by the time we made a thorough 
 search downstream for anything salvageable we would be very short of supplies and would have to abandon the exercise we 
 loaded 0:load 0:ed everything aboard except the 18 foot punt which we cached and returned 0:re 0:turned to the hot 
 springs on arriving there we were informed by gus kraus that he had seen the boat and other items floating 
 by the boat lodged for a time on a shallow bar which gave him time to secure it before 0:be 
 0:fore it was swept on downstream into the splits he had also recovered some of the floating items that had 
 broken loose this was indeed a stroke of fortune we immediately made camp recovered the boat with what was still 
 attached and started to dry out equipment after two days of drying out food sleeping bags and other items it 
 was time to make plans for starting up river again a count of food supplies revealed that we had a 
 maximum of 3 weeks or one month if supplemented with fresh meat fuel was in much shorter supply a mere 
 27 jerricans or approximately 45 hours of running time this meant that we would have to travel light and fast 
 in order to lighten the load i decided to split the party three would remain behind at the hot springs 
 with the bulk of the heavier camp gear and 4 would continue on the trip i did not feel that 
 4 men could make the portage quickly if at all and decided to leave the 18 boat cached and to 
 change our route we would proceed up the nahanni to the flat river 
 the patrician 10 which runs in some 12 miles below the falls then we would go up the flat to 
 the base of the mountain on the southwest side having made plans we loaded the boat and shoved off on 
 the morning of 12 aug by 1300 hrs we were through the first canyon and at a forestry cabin in 
 deadman valley that evening it started to rain heavily and continued for the next two days the rain was so 
 severe and debris on the river made navigation so dangerous that we were forced to hold up until the river 
 cleared on 15 aug with a clearing sky we proceeded into the second canyon we found the river here very 
 swift and the going slow after 13 hours travel we arrived at the gate where we camped for the night 
 the following 0:follow 0:ing night we camped near the mouth of the flat river and on the morning of the 
 17th we started up the flat this river is considerably slower than the nahanni we had been warned that it 
 was shallow and we might have to line or portage in some spots however the rainfall had raised the river 
 level about 2 feet and we were able to make the complete trip up under power on the evening of 
 18 aug we arrived at irvine creek which runs down the northwest side of our mountain and set up base 
 camp the 19th was taken up with recce to determine the most favourable route up the moun capt pa maione 
 and pte brown we climbing mount hamilton gault with main peak in background 
 the patrician 11 tain and preparation of equipment for the ascent although it appeared as if we could make the 
 climb and return to camp in one day we decided to take sleeping bags and enough food for 1 days 
 as it turned out this proved to be a wise move at 0600 on the morning of the 20th we 
 started our climb the mountain had been burned off in the 1940 s and the entire area below tree line 
 was covered with scrub brush thick lodgepole pine and interlaced with burned logs and fallen trees this is very difficult 
 growth to move through and rather than getting easier as we had anticipated it got more difficult as we progressed 
 upward consequently we did not reach treeline until 1500 hours 3 hours later than we had planned we left all 
 of the gear except cameras and film at a camp on a stream just below treeline and hurried on toward 
 the summit we made good time once out of the brush and arrived on the south western peak at 1800 
 hrs daylight hours were running short so we made haste to erect a cairn from slab rock and deposit the 
 cannister 0:can 0:nister on the descent darkness found us still well above our camp but as we were relatively certain 
 of our direction we continued cautiously downward although we did find our camp about an hour after dark night movement 
 in this type of terrain is not recommended the following morning we continued down the mountain by a different 0:dif 
 0:ferent route hoping to find easier going in this we were disappointed pte b rown we lcpl peskett raj and 
 capt pa mai one standing beside the cairn erected atop mount hamilton gault 
 12 and it was a thoroughly footsore and weary foursome that finally arrived at base camp that afternoon it is 
 interesting to note that during the previous night it had snowed on the top of hamilton gault mountain in our 
 absence the flat river had dropped 1 feet and our boat was left high and dry it took about three 
 hours to get it floating again the water level had dropped so much we realized that the river would be 
 too shallow in most places to use the motor and our only alternative was to float down to the nahanni 
 in order to maintain steerage we designed 0:de 0:signed a combination sweep rudder for the boat and removed the motor 
 on the morning of the 23rd tongue in cheek as none of us had ever attempted floating before we set 
 off on our silent trip down river the steering mechanism worked surprisingly well and after having successfully 0:success 0:fully run 
 a few pieces of fast water we relaxed and enjoyed the remainder of the two day journey floating down the 
 flat saved us several hours of fuel so we decided on reaching the nahanni to take the 15 mile trip 
 to virginia falls we were all very anxious to do this as it would have been a shame to miss 
 the virginia falls having been so close it is very fortunate for inexperienced river travellers such as us that the 
 nahanni starts out slow and becomes progressively swifter this gives one an opportunity to gain experience prior to being faced 
 with the worst water in the 12 mile stretch below virginia falls this bit of river includes the famous figure 
 8 and to my mind an even more impressive series of rapids immediately below the falls at 1500 hrs on 
 24 aug we rounded a turn in the river and were confronted with virginia falls one would think that you 
 would be able to at least hear a waterfall higher than niagara falls long before rounding 0:round 0:ing a corner 
 and practically running right into it this is not so at least in this particular case a combination of very 
 fast noisy water below the falls and an anything but silent outboard motor coupled with the sound baffling effect of 
 a meandering canyon create this surprising phenomenon the spray from the falls and the sheer canyon walls preclude camping 0:camp 
 0:ing below the falls so there was no alternative but to pack camp over the 1 1 o mile portage 
 to the top of the falls this is quite a difficult portage and we were grateful that we had decided 
 to change our original plan it is doubtful that four men would have been able to portage the 18 ft 
 punt on arriving at the campsite above the falls we were surprised to find someone already there it was albert 
 faille a legendary character in the nahanni area whom we had thought was farther up river we found that he 
 had returned for more fuel from his cache below the falls and was about to set out upriver again after 
 two very pleasant days of story telling and learning much of the nahanni history we said goodbye and watched him 
 depart in his decrepit 0:de 0:crepit boat with its nine inch sides we then reversed the portage and started a 
 rapid return journey to the hot springs although the trip from the falls to the hot springs can be made 
 easily in one day we stopped overnight at the cabin in deadman valley the weather was 
 13 foul raining and cold and we could not pass up the chance to stay in a warm dry cabin 
 on 27 aug after an early morning two hour run we arrived at the hot springs we found the other 
 three of our party hale and hearty practically turned native and prepared to spend the rest of their lives there 
 this of course was not possible as rations were running short and the weather was beginning to turn cold after 
 two days of sorting stowing equipment and saying farewell to gus kraus and his family we started down river for 
 nahanni butte we were accompanied by father mary an rc missionary who had come up a few days earlier on 
 his regular visit to the kraus family fortunately for us he was able to take some of our load in 
 his boat and being very familiar with recent changes in the splits guided us through without incident at nahanni butte 
 we loaded our stock of gasoline acquired provisions 0:pro 0:visions from dick turner s trading post and set off on 
 the last lap of our return journey to fort nelson on 31 aug because of a heavily overloaded boat which 
 cut our speed to almost a crawl and two days of very bad weather which precluded travel it took us 
 an agonizing ten days to traverse the 300 miles to fort nelson this was almost double the time we had 
 planned on originally and consequently 0:con 0:sequently we had to borrow 45 gallons of gasoline from the forestry department at 
 fort liard at fort nelson we loaded vehicles cleaned ourselves up as much as possible and had a meal out 
 a rare treat i reported in to the rcmp detachment to advise them of our return i also reported that 
 the punt we had left on our inward journey was not to be found where we had cached it with 
 nothing further to be done we mounted our vehicles on the morning of sep 10 and were homeward bound on 
 friday 11 sep the trip of a lifetime was over and the drudgery of cleaning and returning equipment investigations into 
 losses and writing reports began in retrospect the exercise was successful although the original plan had to be modified and 
 eventually completely changed the main object of the exercise was achieved one does not wish for accidents but the adversity 
 which confronted us increased our respect for the forces of nature and tested our flexibility discussion with many of the 
 local rivermen of the nahanni area has lead me to the conclusion that each has his own opinion of which 
 types of boat propulsion and equipment should be used in this sort of venture there are some things upon which 
 all agree and i must mention at least two of these men should be experienced on easier water before attempting 
 0:attempt 0:ing a river like the nahanni and should be thoroughly familiar with the type of equipment they will be 
 using delay caused by inexperience or unfamiliarity with equipment at a crucial time can be and has been fatal to 
 mention detailed requirements would be merely a statement of personal preference and would probably tend to stereotype future adventure 0:ad 
 0:venture training trips of this nature much of the training value and enjoyment of such a trip is in formulating 
 a plan then enjoy watching it succeed or work like mad adapting it to prevent failure

 the patrician 15 the army of a dream g r stevens anniversaries are very worth while they are more than 
 celebrations 0:celebra 0:tions they are recapitulations of the past for their brief space yesterday 0:yester 0:day is at one with 
 today now that is exactly the atmosphere that seemed to me to prevail at edmonton last september at the patricia 
 jubilee to some of us the regiment was a full half century old to others a quarter century to still 
 others those caught up in the korean trouble little more than a decade 0:de 0:cade but in addition there were 
 also those who had served the regiment both in war and in peace and who were in effect the managers 
 of the property which belonged to all of us yet to my eyes all old new and management were of 
 the same family and in kipling s fine phrase had met as gentlemen unafraid for instance we could insult each 
 other with impunity because insults had been common coin of conversation in the days when we had been active members 
 of the family a former lance corporal of mine who now is no end of a swell and public figure 
 having drunk of my bottles in my bedroom continued to remind me of my imperfections until i told him to 
 go stuff it where the monkey put the peanuts this meant no more than a glad re echo of our 
 yesterdays i once wrote a short story wherein i said that at the siege of carthage the roman supply system 
 could not cope with the mediterranean weather often the rations arrived after a sea voyage of several weeks the grapes 
 issue would be shrivelled the plums would be hard as stones the herrings dried and shrunken where upon the troops 
 would tell the quartermastersergeants 0:quartermaster 0:sergeants just what they thought of the rations this still is done but they ate 
 what was given them griping and snarling and calling on their gods to take note of the supperating sons of 
 sea cooks who fought a cushy war in the back area when at long last the war was over they 
 went home to their villages and were greeted with rejoicings and feastings 0:feast 0:ings there were great heaps of luscious 
 grapes dewy from the vines purple blooded plums fresh from the orchards fat herrings just out of the sea did 
 the veterans give thanks they did not instead they said bitterly like men dispossessed do you expect us to eat 
 this stuff where are the raisins the prunes and the kippers to which we have become accustomed it was inevitable 
 that in due course in soldier families that the commander should emerge as the father image responsible for triumph or 
 disaster alike for many centuries he had the power of life or death over his men and there was no 
 other law except his will these were attributes of godhood later on he became a hero or demigod standing out 
 from the common men because he rode a horse and could be seen from afar or because his banner marked 
 a rallying spot or because of his personal prowess when like richard cover de lion he could cleave an enemy 
 from neck to crotch with a single stroke but as war became more intricate the leader needed to be cunning 
 rather than brave clear 
 the patrician 16 headed rather than audacious after napoleon no commander could afford to lead assaults or to take station 
 on a high hill or indeed to offer themselves as targets anywhere instead they sat in some safe and snug 
 place and pored over maps and sent men galloping off with their messages controlling the battle from afar this form 
 of military management was not very comforting to the targets the soldiers who took the shock in the forefront of 
 the battle so the image of the military leader necessarily changed into that of a personality who never forgot that 
 his soldiers were human beings creatures 0:crea 0:tures of hopes and fears who were prone to meditate on the nature 
 of shattering wounds and messy deaths men who although faithful to their oaths of duty and the rigour of their 
 disciplines were happier and better soldiers if they knew that their commander understood their individual 0:in 0:dividual necessities and did 
 not simply regard them as cannon fodder it is my opinion that britain s military greatness stemmed from the fact 
 that her leaders were first to realize this necessity and to arrive 0:ar 0:rive at a new concept in military 
 relationships the wonderful reconstruction 0:recon 0:struction of the battle of agincourt that was recently shown on canadian television revealed a 
 king commander more than five centuries ago to be thinking in terms of the comfort of his men in the 
 field alastair home in his great book on the battle of verdun declares that of allies and enemies alike in 
 the first world war only the british commonwealth 0:common 0:wealth officer was expected to supervise the housing and the feeding 
 of his men before he satisfied his own needs this responsibility was a symbol not only of humanity but of 
 morale which reminds me of fred hurst fred had served in the first world war in the rifle brigade and 
 he told endless stories that undoubtedly had improved with the years one and all they revealed that for him that 
 fine regiment was like a capricious woman from whom he was prepared to put up with a lot of nonsense 
 in order to keep her in his life he had been in 80th brigade with the patricias in the frezenburg 
 fighting and he once told me a story which was characteristic of his attitude towards his regiment you canadians were 
 coming back from polygon wood and we were moving up they began to whizzbang us so bill edwards and me 
 drops into a shellhole along comes one of our little officer boys waving his sword and shouting come on men 
 come on i looks at bill and bill looks at me and i says not bloody likely it s dangerous 
 but bill says someone has got to pick up that little sod if he gets schickered wounded so he climbs 
 out of the shellhole i says cor stone the crows and follows him in 1917 shortly after my return to 
 the patricias with a commission i overheard in the dark on the other side of a traverse in the mericourt 
 trenches two old sweats discussing me fifteen platoon said i hear you ve got that sergeant of ours as your 
 bloke officer what s he like said six platoon oh he s probably all right but her is a bit 
 of a blasted wet nurse six platoon probably was right i was overplaying 0:over 0:playing the welfare act but we 
 junior officers were made in hamilton 
 the patrician 17 gault s image and the essence of him was complete identification with the family that was the 
 regiment that this intimacy and sense of fellowship lives on after fifty years is perhaps the best criterion of its 
 value i would not have you think for a moment that this family atmosphere 0:atmos 0:phere this sense of integration 
 was solely a first world war manifestation 0:mani 0:festation on the contrary i am satisfied that it is a healthy 
 and dynamic 0:dy 0:namic influence in the patricias today as the writer of the third volume of the regimental history 
 i saw evidence of it everywhere in the tween war years when the patricias starved on a pittance because starry 
 eyed idealists were certain that talk would settle everything and if you spoke kindly enough to wolves they would gambol 
 with the lambs in the three year hitch on guard in britain when as farley mowat has so eloquently portrayed 
 in the history of the hastings and prince edward regiment home ties began to grow dim and political indecision and 
 vacillations made the overseas soldier something less than proud of his homeland the regiment tended more and more to become 
 a home from home the principal focus of interest of the serving soldier the british army story of the soldier 
 who christened his daughter gunna regimenta übique 0:ubique is perhaps exaggerated but in the second world war there were more and 
 more fields in which the regiment and the ship and the squadron became if not father and mother at least 
 the foster parents of those who served therein it was great good luck that in that war two canadian divisions 
 should have spent virtually all their field service in eighth army it is doubtful if the world has ever seen 
 or will see again anything like that formation in three years in africa it had taught british indian australian new 
 zealand south african polish french greek and jewish soldiers to keep each others backs as well as to respect and 
 admire each other in sicily and italy the canadians were accepted as honoured members by their service to others they 
 wrote their names on the entablatures 0:enta 0:blatures of many nations canadian armour supported british divisions and in similar fashion 
 british and new zealand tanks supported canadian 0:cana 0:dian infantry those who were with the patricias at the moro crossing 
 will remember how 44th royal tank regiment closed up in a moment of extremity with officers standing in open turrets 
 to guide fire and to take on the encroaching panzers at point blank range indeed when the time came to 
 reunite the canadian forces in northwestern europe many of ist infantry and sth armoured divisions resented the loss of the 
 crusaders 0:cru 0:saders shield on their shoulders and said in the language of farley mowat s bitter picton men that 
 they would rather stay where they were yet time must march on and bring changes in its train and the 
 unadaptable 0:un 0:adaptable species dies no family today could possibly be what it was twenty five years ago unless it 
 was cut off completely from outside communications 0:com 0:munications one of the great problems of this age is alienation the 
 process by which machinery and technology restrict human contacts and limit the cooperation and comradeship of man and his brother 
 man every hour of the day and for much of the night we are bombarded with a profusion and confusion 
 of ideas entreaties arguments special pleadings 
 the patrician 18 this monstrous flood of impacts aided and abetted by propaganda and advertising which only differs in degree 
 from brainwashing has made great inroads on independence of thought and judgment as a consequence any form of human association 
 including military family groupings that tends to stick to its code and resists the erosion of manners morals and cultural 
 heritages deserves well of the nation during the ceremonials and celebrations at hamilton gault barracks last september the thought came 
 to me on more than one occasion that here was a community which to some extent at least was insulated 
 against the irritations the irrelevancies the tensions and the absurdities which bedevil civilian life nowadays i would hesitate to suggest 
 that princess patricia s canadian light infantry live monastically or in an ivory tower or anything like that but i 
 thought i detected something of the advantages of the cloister in a community of men dedicated to a common 0:com 
 0:mon purpose and employment communally fed clothed and housed with stabilized routines and inter relationships with ample time for leisure 
 and few incentives to excess it would indeed be sardonic if the last haunts of true peace of mind would 
 be found in the tents of men committed to making war which brings to mind meg 88 pte sherman f 
 j of the 2nd universities company destined to reinforce the patricias in the summer 0:sum 0:mer of 1915 this middle 
 aged recruit literally had stowed away in order to enlist for he was one of the leading banking authorities of 
 canada his escape was detected and on a fine summer day while we lay at at sir john moore s 
 plain near shorncliffe an imposing staff car entered the lines it bore that rambunctious personality general sam hughes minister of 
 defence and by his own admission one of the chief impediments to german world conquest on alighting general hughes demanded 
 that pte sherman be produced what passed between them is unknown but pte fuzzy brozen a born gossip who was 
 said to have qualified for the universities company 0:com 0:pany by producing a certificate from a barber college gave us 
 what he claimed to be the pukkha gen of the interview he said that general hughes bade pte sherman remember 
 his duty to his country to say nothing of the party in power he must abandon this unseemly masquerade 0:masque 
 0:rade and accept an appointment commensurate with his talents whereupon 0:where 0:upon sherman replied that the rear rank of an 
 infantry platoon was the place that he had been seeking all his life there he was bountifully cared for without 
 expense to himself or without expenditure of energy his duties 0:dut 0:ies were ridiculously simple they involved few decisions and 
 no worries he had ample leisure and he liked the people that he had about him they were neither avaricious 
 nor ambitious nor cunning nor importunate he was paid enough twice in every month to get tiddly of an evening 
 which was as often as drink was good for him he had found serenity he thanked 0:thank 0:ed the minister 
 of defence but he felt that he had come into his kingdom thus said pte brozen who in his nickelodeon 
 days had acquired a sense of theatre a private told a major general to go to hell i hope that 
 this was so i am certain that sherman chose the better part i therefore like to think that as the 
 years pass and machines multiply and take on more and more human functions until finally we are dehuman

 to the historic cloth hall established in the middle ages completely destroyed in world war i and now restored this

 the jubilee celebrations in europe with our minds full of those wonderful 0:won 0:derful traditions handed down by former patricias 
 and our emotions strained by the jubilee celebrations we then turned to the tactics of the modern battlefield at the 
 end of august the unit returned to field training for the soltau concentration training progressed up to battalion group level 
 and in the brigade exercises the battalion came through in fine style proving themselves to be excellent infiltrators the lunenburg 
 health saw many battles fought but fortunately unlike the past no memorials and no unknown graves were left behind although 
 weapons and equipment have changed considerably many soldiers must have felt as former patricia s felt in other wars cold 
 wet and miserable in their lonely trench the next month september brought the liberation ceremonies at the calais monument aux 
 morts the canadian contingent was commanded 0:command 0:ed by captain al hill and the unit platoon by lieutenant rd gillan 
 in attendance was the prime minister of france mr georges pompidou the british ambassador to france sir john pierson dixon 
 the canadian ambassador to france mr jules leger and the mayor of calais from september 29th to october 9th the 
 patricia s operated with the brigade in exercise treble chance and were opposed by the british 6th brigade and german 
 armour the canadians managed to baffle the enemy with their tactics at one stage during the exercise the enemy had 
 thought that one company of canadians had infiltrated through their lines but it was in fact the whole of the 
 first patricia s the commanding 0:com 0:manding officer was extremely enthused with the superlative performance 0:perfor 0:mance of and ferocity 
 shown by all ranks of the battalion in this difficult 0:dif 0:ficult manoeuvre the goc 2 br div and the

 high principles who gave exceptional service to the regiment to end this article the story of private gr peterson should 
 be quoted in february 1964 he was overpaid 6300 deutsche marks by the bank of montreal in hemer due to 
 a double error this mistake may not have been discovered for quite some time however peterson returned the excess 0:ex 
 0:cess the next morning and earned the the commendation of the bank manager for his integrity and honesty the moral 
 is obvious but the writer feels that is typical of the hard but honest year of the battalion when all 
 patricias worked hard and showed their true worth in joining the front ranks of nato all ranks of the first 
 battalion can now look back with pride on the year 1964 and look forward to the challenge of conversion to

 jubilee report dusk was falling on the westphalian hills as the colonel in chief s limousine drove on to the 
 parade square and quietly drew up by the reviewing 0:re 0:viewing stand several thousand hushed people waited expectantly for a 
 glimpse of the honoured personage whose presence was a sign that the first battalion s jubilee celebrations were about to 
 commence now the months of planning and weeks of preparations would finally culminate in three days of parades and pageantry 
 that will live for a life time in the memory of those who were present as lady patricia stepped from 
 her car and turned towards the spectators 0:spec 0:tators a tall figure rose from his seat and in a voice 
 which carried across the parade square cried three cheers for our colonel in chief the cheers were led by a 
 soldier brigadier wg colquhoun who had been on parade with his colonel in chief 50 years before and were picked 
 up and roared as a greeting to lady patricia as she mounted the dias with the colonel of the regiment 
 
 the patrician 32 this simple and spontaneous greeting by those who remembered the colonel in chief from days past and 
 for those whose privilege it was to see her for the first time broke the stillness of the evening and 
 the solemnity 0:solem 0:nity of the occasion to such a degree that all now were prepared for an evening s 
 entertainment the retreat ceremony was performed by the regimental band of the rhc and the corps of drums of 2 
 rcha fgh 1 rcr and 1 ppcli plus the pipes and drums of 2 rhc on the far side of 
 the parade square the battle honours of the regiment were displayed in three columns dressed in the regimental colours at 
 the base of each column stood a soldier representing three periods of the regiments service world war 1 world war 
 2 and the present day as the bands played and marched before the spectators large searchlights 0:search 0:lights illuminated the 
 parade square and the back drop emphasizing the colour of the occasion each corps and band performed an individual selection 
 0:selec 0:tion before the finale which was a medley of world war 1 and world war 2 songs that scarcely 
 left a dry eye amongst the spectators the retreat ceremony followed and itself was concluded by the last post played 
 by a bugler atop a building at the far side of the parade square the final touch was provided by 
 the piper whose lament came forth from the tower of the roman catholic church and completed the musical score of

 and the veterans gathered in the camp to remember those of the regiment who had fallen in battle during the 
 regiment s 50 years of service to canada services were held in bright sunshine for both denominations as soldiers and 
 veterans alike gathered with bowed heads to honour their comrades the celebrations reached their peak of the afternoon of august 
 10th fifty years exactly to the date of the signing of the regimental charter four thousand spectators sat and gazed 
 with admiration and wonder at the movements of six splendid guards as they performed the ritual of trooping the colour 
 before their colonel in chief for the soldiers on parade this day had been rehearsed countless times and now before 
 their colonel in chief they were able to show their pride of being in the manner which they performed the 
 ceremony although the day was wet the pride of the men could not be dampened nor the spectators enthusiasm for 
 the parade diminished at the conclusion of the trooping the battalion faced inwards and the colour party advanced to a 
 position in front of the dias whereupon the colonel in chief reenacted a ceremony which had been done initially at 
 bramshott park england following the end of world war i the colonelin chief 0:colonel 0:in 0:chief had chosen to decorate 
 the regimental colour with a replica of the wreath of laurel that she had presented to the regiment in recognition

 after a period of 45 years all the glory of sacrifice was remembered as the colour came erect and the 
 wreath of laurel could be seen by all proudly the colour party returned to the ranks as a finale and

 were situated near us all irwf members and their ladies were invited to a getting to know you party held 
 in the gym this turned out to be a tremendous success which was climaxed a few days later by our 
 attendance at the rwf st david s ball the brigade sergeants mess hosted our mess for a happy hour early 
 in march a chorus of dentureless vocalists did their best to entertain the quieter fellows en route and on the 
 return journey this they accomplished as the stories will confirm a mixed dining in was held on march 16th with 
 a successful social evening afterwards the 17th of march dawned clear and cool which is more than we can say 
 for the following morning eight members of other units in the brigade who were former senior ncos of the patricia 
 s were invited to attend and participate in all the mess functions for the day much to their enjoyment when 
 the fog cleared the medics had returned to their dispensaries and the rsm had retrieved his clothes we found that 
 the sergeants mess had won the broom i 100 this was dutifully celebrated with the officers a few minutes later 
 the victors being the hosts april was spent preparing for the planned summer exercises but we did enjoy the visits 
 of several of the brigade sergeants messes many of their members feeling very much at home in our surroundings eight

 later by the death of our good friend he is sadly missed by his family friends and all those who 
 appreciated a good soldier october and november were quiet months jarred only by the sight of limping mess members the

 in germany began in 1964 it was also the commencement of the battalion s fiftieth anniversary celebrations more commonly known 
 as the jubilee year due to the rota 
 the patrician 44 tion of the battalion to europe in the late fall of 1963 the mess did not hold 
 a new year s ball the next major event was the celebration of the birthday of our colonel in chief 
 lady patricia the day s events culminated with the junior ranks ball the large attendance made it successful and fitting 
 way to end the day s events june brought about our first major exercise as the junior ncos were introduced 
 to the dusty plains of sennelager during the concentration the sergeants mess hosted the corporals in a games night the 
 games played were darts whist bridge phat and the famous boat race in all events with the exception of the 
 boat race the messes were tied the boat race was conducted under the eagle eye of the rsm however even 
 with this handicap the corporals managed to win the rsm presented the mess with the fur cup emblematic of the 
 intermess championship in sports the corporals mess entered the 4 cibg corporals mess league with teams in hockey and softball 
 this was the first year the mess formed a hockey team for competition in the final analysis the mess finished 
 runners up in the league in the field of boxing the mess has a british army champion in l cpl

 barker ce grant and kunsch the mess also has added several new faces during the past year a record hop 
 night was held in december and a large turn out of members and wives made the function a complete success 
 in conclusion 1964 provided many new experiences for the members and their families in germany men s canteen it was 
 a year of progress as well as jubilee for the men of the patricia arms at fort macleod most of 
 the activity was in changing the atmosphere a considerable amount of redecoration was planned and carried out to enhance building 
 12 so that it looked more like home probably 0:pro 0:bably the most comfortable room is the wvs lounge operated 
 by miss joan barter of the woman s voluntary service life in germany is more difficult for the unattached soldier 
 homesickness 0:home 0:sickness is an ailment for which the mo cannot prescribe any medicine to relieve part of the problem 
 it is now possible to obtain a beer at lunch time and the happy hour has been reinstated the billiard 
 room and tv lounge are open during duty hours to soldiers on leave it is a credit to the men 
 that these privileges have not been abused now that most of the work is over the apc men are looking 
 forward to the challenges of 1965 
 the patrician 45 prix leclerc 1964 one of the many priorities of the battalion on its arrival in germany was 
 to prepare a weapons team to compete with the other two infantry battalions of 4 cibg 2 rhc and 1 
 rcr the teams consisted of 24 men 12 riflemen 2 pistol members 5 lmg crews each of 2 men and 
 4 spares the winner of the brigade competition would represent canada at the yearly nato prix leclerc small arms competition 
 the aim of the prix leclerc competition is to foster a high standard 0:stan 0:dard of small arms training within 
 the armies of the allied countries of the north atlantic treaty organization in accordance with the wishes of the originator 
 of the competition sir eugene millington drake the competition takes place under conditions approximating as nearly as possible 0:pos 0:sible 
 those of war the competition therefore is more similar to a field firing exercise than a dcra type competition the 
 object in naming the competition after french marshal leclerc 1902 1947 is to preserve the memory and example of an 
 outstanding leader he was commander of the famous french 2nd armoured division which was the first to enter paris and 
 strasbourg in 1944 the actual prize for the winner is a bronze bust of marshal leclerc the patricia team practiced 
 diligently under the able coaching of wo 2 white la from january to march surprisingly defeating 2 rhc 1 ppcli 
 prix leclerc team at hagenau france after the nato competition with mascot and second place plaque in foreground 
 the patrician 46 and 1 rcr the team for this competition was presented the currie trophy by brig dare commander 
 of 4 cibg the time from march until the nato competition was spent in intensified 0:in 0:tensified training and friendly 
 competitions with the dutch belgium and british teams it was interesting to compare and fire the weapons of our competitors 
 many close friendships arose as a result of these matches the host nation france held the 1964 competition at hagenau 
 ranges in france near baden baden on 31 july during the day of the competition 0:com 0:petition tension was very 
 high among the teams the hot arid weather similar to wainwright on a sandy range also added to the discomfort 
 of the competitors however all teams fired well in spite of these conditions with the netherlands teams taking first place 
 canada 1 ppcli second belgium third usa fourth great britain fifth germany sixth and france the perfect host seventh and 
 last the 1965 patricia team has begun training and hopes are high that they will win the brigade eliminations and 
 do better for the unit and for canada in this year s prix leclerc competition rod and gun club after 
 our arrival in germany it was decided to attempt to form a rod and gun club the club was initiated 
 in march 1964 with a membership of seven for the purpose of pistol shooting now less than a year later 
 the club has an active membership of ninety five the club activities include pistol and small bore rifle shooting skeet 
 and trap and fishing which includes lessons on tying flies under the guidance of sgt jt maclsaac beginners in shooting 
 receive coaching from wo 2 la white in pistol sgt ag kenny in rifle and sgt rm davis in shotgun 
 the members have also taken advantage of the lower prices for weapons which can be attained through the club before 
 christmas last year a very successful turkey shoot was organized 0:or 0:ganized a great many hopefuls nipped over to the 
 indoor range to try their luck a total of thirty seven turkeys were given away as prizes activities planned for 
 the next year include friendly matches with other clubs improvement on the skeet range archery and the possibility of a

 the patrician 50 carried on as president and monthly meetings began shortly after rotation was complete one of the first 
 projects organized was a system for visiting those members who were living on the german economy since we did not 
 have the convenience of telephones the only methods of communication were letters and personal visits the economy visiting was designed 
 to keep in touch with the wives who lived further out visits were also made regularly to the british military 
 hospital and german hospitals where dependents of the battalion were convalescing magazines and books were taken to the patients on 
 these visits at the monthly meetings there were many varied displays of merchandise 0:mer 0:chandise which never failed to attract 
 the eyes of the members these displays were shown after a short business meeting displays at various meetings included those 
 of glass blown articles copper brass inlaid wood and bavarian goods husbands would often see their wives coming home from 
 a meeting with their arms full of boxes containing the merchandise which sold very well the wives club has made 
 many generous donations to the battalion so far the club purchased a stereo radio phonograph combination for the men s 
 canteen an item very much appreciated by the men in addition donations were made towards the jubilee and the children 
 s christmas party in march 1964 the reins of the club were turned over to mrs jan stirling who performed 
 the task very competently until her departure in november mrs r larson was recently elected as president with mrs cole

 trail 99 there are many reasons why a young man becomes a soldier the usual reasons given are adventure travel 
 the outdoor life being a man s man patriotism security family tradition excitement a desire to lead men and a 
 host of other reasons to a soldier becoming a parachutist fulfills some of these young desires to lead a small 
 band of professional volunteers on an independent mission adds zest to the life of both the leader and his men 
 words and phrases such as guerrilla partisan commando special 0:spec 0:ial warfare and unconventional warfare have sent the imaginations of 
 many a young soldier throughout history into the world of walter mitty the twentieth century has once again revived these 
 words and phrases and they have regained a place in the headlines of the world s newspapers give a young 
 soldier an opportunity to play lawrence of arabia and you will lift him out of the khaki world in which 
 he may feel insignificant and place him in the position of supreme commander of a small force which considers itself 
 invincible the soldier then is newborn revitalized confident in his own ability and ready to show his contemporaries his ability 
 to succeed in battle such a situation presented itself during exercise 0:exer 0:cise caribou trail caribou trail was born of 
 the new awareness that the canadian soldier must prepare himself to adjust to the changing face of modern warface and 
 be prepared to fight a war in which communism has set the ground rules the 1 cibg aim of caribou 
 trail was to exercise the brigade units in field operations under winter conditions to test their ability to cope with 
 guerilla operations in isolated areas and to develop anti guerilla warfare drills phase i commenced for ppcli task force with 
 a parachuted invasion of enemy held territory three separate drops were made with 1 platoon parachuting on bushy head hill 
 bnhq and the remainder of a company group parachuting on a dz near observation hill a dummy drop took place

 sides from 08 mar to noon 12 mar 64 small bands of patricia s gallantly led havrassed the enemy convoys 
 and played a game of cat and mouse all along grey route the qor of c using a shutte system 
 moved troops from one firm base to another along the msr and fought for each twist and turn in the 
 road each new encounter saw convoy after convoy battling 0:bat 0:tling with the enemy at road blocks minefields and defended 
 infantry positions each encounter usually resulted in qor of c being heavily reinforced and with the aid of aircraft attempting 
 to encircle and destroy ja fleeing enemy which was constantly under the eyes of the air cover survival of the 
 guerillas depended on their physical condition knowledge of the terrain and the ability to know when to disengage to stand 
 and fight after they had achieved their initial gains in some cases lead to jdisaster phase i taught both sides 
 a great deal about the problems involved 0:in 0:volved in guerrilla and counter guerrilla warfare at the completion of phase 
 i all troops concentrated on grey route the qor of c and 2 ppcli reformed with their respective armoured elements 
 and 2 ppcli proceeded to carry out a fighting withdrawal to hart hill the early dawn of 12 mar 64 
 found the leading elements of the queen s own engaged with the entrenched rearguard of the patricias knd the battle 
 started at 0955 hours an otter aircraft airlanded a qor recce patrol at airfield 9 behind the ppcli main defensive 
 position a sspecial force comprising b company 2 ppcli 2 qor of c and a sqn ldsh rc was launched 
 at 1200 hours to move cross country and cut the ppcli line of communication between airfield 4 and grizzley village 
 following fierce fighting with moves and counter moves which found 12 ppcli holding hart hill an enemy battalion attack was 
 launched at 1800 hours on the 12 mar 64 and was successful as ppcli withdrew just prior to the attack 
 the qor of c held the hill throughout the night and both sides engaged in aggressive patrolling during the night 
 a bold plan was formulated by oc a company group 2 ppcli which consisted of a silent first light attack 
 the infantry was to move into position just s north of the hill with an armoured thrust swinging in from 
 the east flank the hill was to be blanketed by artillery smoke and he to as isist in the deception 
 the ruse proved most successful a company i group surged in at the base of the hill and caught the 
 enemy by surprise i due to the greater numbers of the qor of c the ppcli attack to regain the 
 hill was unsuccessful and a cease fire was declared at 0700 hours the battle had ended exercise caribou trail brought 
 into clearer focus the problems involved in a war of this kind all ranks learned the difficulties involved in guerrilla 
 and counter guerrilla operations and were to fight in what has jbecome known as the twilight war

 cast was predominantly serving patricias from second battalion the regimental depot and the regimental band the can can girls for 
 the paris scenes and a sprinkling of other specialists were recruited locally the ric a dam doo was primarily a 
 musical show and the soloists chorus and bands under the able direction of capt herb jeffrey performed 0:per 0:formed magnificently 
 throughout the setting of the show varied as the demands for the canadian army over the past fifty years summoned 
 the patricias to two wars in europe and one in asia the presence of four bands in full dress added 
 much colour to the show and the massed bands retreat was indeed an appropriate finale the performance was repeated in 
 edmonton on 25 mar 64 as a musical salute to edmonton and a modified version was staged in the winnipeg 
 auditorium on 23 sep 64 as part of the winnipeg association celebration of our jubilee there is no doubt that 
 this show did not receive the widespread 0:wide 0:spread acclaim of the original patricia concert party nor did it approximate

 at 1830 hours the regimental band second battalion corps of drums and the city of edmonton police pipe band presented 
 a stirring programme of music the presence of the edmonton police pipe band was most fitting because it perpetuates although 
 perhaps unofficially the pipe band of the st andrews society of edmonton which moved to ottawa en masse in 1914 
 and announced to colonel farquhar that they had come to play the regiment to france and back again it is 
 believed that at least three of these original pipers were edmonton city policemen following the retreat ceremony all patricia s 
 were welcomed to the home station at an all ranks reception held in the leonforte building many an old acquaintance 
 was renewed during the course of the evening and many of the younger members of the regiment had an opportunity

 the command patricias to the old guard 1 present arms and the band played a chorus of we are the 
 boys of the old brigade there was no doubt in the minds of those present that some of the boys 
 of the old brigade were once again on parade and i still capable of a very high standard of performance 
 guests attended an jall ranks reception in the drill hall following the ceremony while lady ipatricia received veterans and representatives 
 of serving members the bday was brought to a pleasant and relaxing conclusion with formal dances in respective messes a

 since its arrival in france at the end of 1914 when it was incorporated in th british 27th division have 
 been at all times honourable and worthy ol the finest traditions of our race and i will now beg him 
 the founder to allow me to place on the colour a wreath of laurel as a token of mj deep 
 admiration for and pride in all who have served in my regimen since 1914 this is the only occasion in 
 the history of the armies of the britisl commonwealth that a wreath has been awarded to a regimental colour a

 the battalion being sandwiched be tween the greek and turkish cypriots in nicosia since then we hay returned to england 
 this letter is written at a time when the battalio is preparing itself operationally to assume its spearhead role in 
 1 infantry brigade group the strategic reserve in england the beginning of 1964 saw the battalion patrolling the deserted street 
 of nicosia its main task being supervising the resettlement of turkisl cypriots into their looted homes endeavouring to keep the 
 two communit ies apart and trying to keep the explosive situation under control in february 0:feb 0:ruary we moved to 
 the famagusta area which allowed companies to b detached to regions which coincided with those of the police gendarmerie our 
 unannounced arrival was not popular with the locals who resentei military intrusion into a peaceful area however by tactful patrolling 
 am personal contact with the community leaders we became accepted ou task was mainly negotiating between the two sides especially 
 in the out laying villages harvest protection ensuring freedom of movement in vestigation of road blocks and isolated shooting incidents 
 were small but at the same time important duties that needed careful and impartial in vestigation the end of march 
 saw us back in our own barracks in dhekelia hay ing handed over our area to the united nations force 
 except for routin guards and duties life appeared for the moment to be almost back ti normal full use was 
 made of this stand down with a riflemans christ mas lunch in place of the one that many missed in 
 december a bat talion concert which produced some surprising talent and a long week end break however this period of 
 relaxation did not last long the pipe line which carried water from the neighbouring villages was blown severa times and 
 even a pumphouse was demolished increased security pre cautions were enforced in and around the base

 another 0:an 0:other permanently guarding a large ammunition dump one company in rotation came into barracks for a fortnight s 
 rest and retraining it was a long tedious and unexciting task and in this way we finished the last six 
 months of our three year tour in cyprus our future was to be five jmonths in england followed by a 
 nine month unaccompanied tour in aden october saw the battalion on leave and an advance party opening up our new 
 home in felixstowe east anglia our move to aden had been cancelled and when the riflemen returned from leave in 
 november they learned that they were now part of the strategic reserve retraining and fitness training have taken priority and

 the patrician 88 the branch has placed all its members on a first name basis highlight of the year for 
 many of us was the visit to edmonton in september and the memory of it all will long be remembered 
 with deep feeling and great pride in our famous and beloved regiment plans for 1965 include the formation of a 
 ladies auxiliary montreal this brief story of the activities of the montreal branch goes bad to november 1963 like most 
 organizations in big cities we find it difficult 0:dif 0:ficult to bring out the boys on formal occasions but in 
 the patrici tradition our spirit is strong and there is still a large group of veteran who foregather with encouraging 
 frequency in the ordinary routine o business life in addition we in montreal were doubly fortunate because 0:be 0:cause for 
 many years we enjoyed the inestimable companionship of a hamilton gault and we like to think that he left his 
 mark on us montreal is a great port of call and this helps to keep us alive most of our 
 meetings formal or otherwise are occasioned by the arrival 0:ar 0:rival in town of someone who has served or is 
 still serving with the regiment 0:re 0:giment for instance on november 7 1963 we welcomed the colonel o the regiment 
 who had with him lt col george brown cd commandin officer 1 ppcli which was en route to germany colonel 
 brown wai accompanied by capt cw hewson his adjutant and capt rm mcintosh the son of the late major mcgregor 
 f mcintosh among those presen were general arthur potts and colonel stu graham and also colontl kenny kinnaird an old 
 companion of the patricias and honorary colcnel 0:colc 0:nel of the loyal edmonton regiment 3 ppcli last april stuart cobbett 
 and his charming wife generously an i rashly threw open their house to a party of world war ii veterans 
 t entertain colonel slug clark and his good lady margaret colonel an 1 mrs jim stone came from ottawa for 
 the occasion lavish hospitality good fellowship and the availability of a piano with denis jotcham t play it created a 
 patricia situation which almost removed the cobbett permanently from the neighbourhood a few weeks later on may 7tr l jim 
 stone came back to us as the guest speaker at our formal cele bration of frezenberg day this almost legendary 
 officer of both th 1 loyal edmontons and the patricias made a great impression on a neai record turnout of 
 members many of whom had not met him bef or jim was reinforced from out of town by bucko watson 
 arthur pott senior and junior bunchy newlands roger schjelderup and bill dav son these visitations from ottawa and elsewhere are 
 vastly appr ciated throughout the winter and spring we had been constantly reminde 1 of the forthcoming jubilee everyone in 
 the branch had witnessed th devoted efforts and responded to the leadership of our national presider t and fellow montrealer 
 jimmy delalanne since it was not expected tht t j montreal would be the scene of the formal celebrations our 
 executh i gladly cooperated with the ottawa branch in their planning for a r union in that city we would 
 like to salute them for a magnificent piec 1 1 of planning and execution we were far away from germany 
 and ec monton nevertheless several montreal members and wives manage 
 the patrician 89 to be present at the ceremonies in one or other of these regimental centres 0:cen 0:tres jimmy 
 delalanne was at both bill perry was in germany while roy stevens clarence lelievre dan pollock and rowan coleman witnessed 
 0:wit 0:nessed the impressive programme in edmonton all patricia veterans who had the privilege of being present came away fiercely 
 proud of what the present generation is doing to preserve and enhance our traditions 0:tra 0:ditions and it goes without 
 saying proud of the opportunity to see our gracious colonel in chief again the splendidly organized reunion in ottawa attracted 
 a very large representation from montreal a few days later mrs gault came to our city where her sole official 
 engagement was the unveiling at st hilaire of a memorial cairn erected by mcgill university in tribute to brigadier gault 
 who bequeathed his beloved estate to the university he stone was draped with a mcgill flag and a regimental camp 
 colour mrs ah gault unveiling a memorial stone marking the donation of mount st hilaire to mcgill university 
 the patrician 90 to mark the magnificent gault donation to mcgill university govenors 0:gov 0:enors senators and guests assembled at 
 mont st hilaire on tuesday september 29th 1964 in 1958 brigadier a hamilton gault bequeathed mont st hilaire to mcgill 
 university mont st hilaire is an impressive member of a group of eight mountains that rise above the lowland plain 
 of the st lawrence river in the vicinity of montreal these eight hills are called mounteregian and constitute a distinct 
 geological type with a unique origin these mountains have a place in the history of quebec and the montreal region 
 mont st hilaire because of its imposing position on the st lawrence plain was the first of them to be 
 viewed by cartier and his men when they ascended the river in 1535 the estate extends over 2 200 acres 
 contains a small lake and has mountain peaks that range from 900 to 1 363 feet the memorial cairn marking 
 the donation bears a quotation on the tablet from brig gault s will offering the mountain to the immediate interests 
 of the university and as a great heritage for the benefit 0:bene 0:fit and enjoyment of the youth of canada 
 on the following day a group of patricias and other montreal friends 0:fri 0:ends held an informal reception for the 
 delightful lady who is so close to the regiment space does not permit a detailed description of the many activities 
 carried on by members of the branch but as we all know one of our number continues to make a 
 name for himself in the field of military history as well as other literary endeavours colonel roy stevens who wrote 
 volume 111 of the regimental history had just published his history of the loyal edmonton regiment and will shortly complete 
 a history of the royal canadian regiment during the past year he has also finished another volume of a monumental 
 history of the cnr to our delight we keep finding old patricias most of whom arrive 0:ar 0:rive in this 
 great city and are uncertain as to how to get in touch with us or unaware of our existence we 
 recently welcomed major david settin who was with the regiment in germany in the 50 s and very recently we 
 learned that major david corrigal a permanent force officer 0:of 0:ficer between the wars and the father of a popular 
 world war ii officer 0:of 0:ficer had returned to montreal he can be reached at ste anne s military 0:mili 
 0:tary hospital ste anne de bellevue we have also with pleasure taken on strength from ottawa a powerful transfer in 
 the person of glen bannerman who is with expo 67 the passing of beloved comrades is the only sad fact 
 which we have to record during the past year mr justice gregor barclay gl kohl dm cunningham and j davidson

 and has been helpful 0:help 0:ful to us in many ways besides taking over a large share of the welfare 
 the ladies searched out and trapped down the dormant scholarship fund established by the woman s auxiliary in 1947 one 
 scholarship was granted during the year and we are expecting that five or six will be authorized during 1965 providing 
 qualified applicants can be found the preparatory work required to put on the jubilee celebrations in winnipeg was enthusiastically and 
 cheerfully carried out by the members this project not only welded our members together into an efficient working 0:work 0:ing 
 team but also brought out many new members that had not been too active in the past the programme in 
 winnipeg was first class and was carried out without 0:with 0:out any major complications it commenced with the arrival of 
 the official 0:of 0:ficial party at the winnipeg international airport at 3 30 pm on 21 september 0:sep 0:tember this 
 was followed by press radio and tv interviews of the official 0:of 0:ficial party at the fort garry hotel the 
 following morning at 1100 hours the mayor of winnipeg presented 0:pre 0:sented an honorary citizenship scroll to maj gen ware 
 city crests to 
 the patrician 95 brig j a de lalanne and mrs gault and a city plaque to the ppcli association 0:as 
 0:sociation winnipeg branch the ceremony although brief was very impressive 0:im 0:pressive being held on the steps of the new 
 city hall after the ceremony a luncheon was held at fort osborne barracks officers mess at which the mayor and 
 aldermen were guests of the regiment 0:regi 0:ment and the winnipeg branch during the afternoon the ppcli band and 2 
 ppcli drums put on a band concert for the veterans of deer lodge hospital after which the official party visited 
 wheelchair and bed patients in the hospital at 1800 hours the ppcli band and 2 ppcli drums put on a 
 spectacular 0:specta 0:cular retreat ceremony at the legislative building keeping the tempo of events at a high pitch an association 
 stag was held during the evening 0:even 0:ing for maj gen ware at which over a 150 members attended simultaneously 
 0:simultane 0:ously the ladies auxiliary held an at home at mrs leech s residence for the ladies on the 23rd 
 the winnipeg branch held a luncheon at the fort garry hotel for our visiting dignitaries after which they proceeded to 
 the legislative 0:leg 0:islative building and were presented to the premier of manitoba the honorable duff roblin a second retreat 
 ceremony was held at the legislative building at 1800 hours and was closely followed by a formal dinner for the 
 official party and their guests at the fort osborne barracks officers mess our main attraction a musical salute to manitoba 
 was held at the winnipeg auditorium at 8 30 pm this musical salute production combined music narrations and humorous interpretations 
 of the many situations that had developed over the 50 years of existence of a proud regiment the main cast 
 of approximately 150 were provided by ppcli band 2 ppcli drums serving members of the regiment and supported by rcha 
 band pipes from the camerons of canada band mcconnel school of dancers and the fort osborne drama club the only 
 sour note was the small public attendance of 1400 paid admissions which was well below our expectations 0:ex 0:pectations the 
 good press notices and reviews we feel would have ensured 0:en 0:sured a sellout crowd if a second night performance 
 had been held although 0:al 0:though it is regrettable that we had to take a loss on the jubilee celebrations 
 0:cele 0:brations we feel that both our branch and the regiment gained much more in publicity and popularity than we 
 lost in dollars and cents after the musical salute various receptions were held for our guests and the cast all 
 good things must come to a close and it was with reluctance that we bade good bye to the official 
 party the following afternoon 24 september 0:sep 0:tember at the winnipeg international airport the war amputations club of canada were 
 most generous during our jubilee celebrations and allowed us the use of their lounge as our operational headquarters from the 
 above report you can see that 1964 has been a very memorial and successful year our association is stronger now 
 than it has ever been and we intend to keep it that way our welfare and social plans for 1965 
 are in high gear and we are positive that we can meet our objective 0:ob 0:jective of 200 paid up
