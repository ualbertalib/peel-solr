 to get collected enough buffalo it was always a feast or a famine chips to cook our dinner and supper
 with the indians when food was plentiafter that they became so wet they ful the pot was always on night
 and would not burn so we went to bed and day they had no regular time to eat had to
 stay there all the next day and and when one got hungry the rest were eat pemmican and dried buffalo
 meat ready to eat when food was scarce by the following morning the storm had they just tightened up their
 belts passed over leaving nearly two and a half feet of snow david mcdougall during the construction of the c

 were to kill when to make a fire as we came farther west they got to camp they took their
 wives this sketch of the morley mission was made in about the same year that andrew sibbald arrived it was
 based on a drawing by mounted police surgeon b b neavitt along to cook for them next evening back in
 the evening in great excitement when the rev john william grier and and reported to david that the sioux myself
 arrived there was nothing left indians were coming as they had heard of the ox but the tongue and no
 work their war whoops coming up the valley was done at that time there was not a sioux within during
 the summer of the sioux ex 200 miles of the place nevertheless citement after the custer fight all our david
 believed them and had all the indians were away from the mission indians in the vicinity come to his place
 hunting in the mountains in the north and prepare to meet the sioux he gave one could hunt and kill

 through the courtesy and the methodist church census of edmonton area edmonton bulletin j an 31 1881 the unofficial census
 which has just been completed gives the following as the adult population of the principal settlements in this district with

 victoria 46 decrease 12 total 766 total increase 163 the apparent decrease in some of the settlements is on account
 of many who formerly were counted as half breeds taking the treaty thereby taking rank as indians the total population
 has of course increased much more than is apparent as children are not counted in this census on cattle train
 and cattle boat i ‘ i tl by charles mckillop editor s note the author of this paper came to
 lethbridge in 1886 and spent the next sixteen years as pastor of knox presbyterian church he was one of the
 most well known and respected clergymen in southern alberta at that time in 1902 with his health beginning to fail
 he moved to raymond alberta to take charge of a smaller church however when his condition continued to deteriorate arrangements
 were made for him to return to his native scotland by the inexpensive method of cattle train and cattle boat
 on his return in order to share the voyage with his friends he wrote two accounts which he sent to
 the lethbridge herald these were published on nov 1 st and 29 th 1906 the rev mr mckillop resigned from
 his rajmond post in april 1907 and passed away in lethbridge four months later for many years i had longed
 for sometimes no place to sleep except the a trip across the atlantic ocean to revisit benches i believe we
 did not ride in the scenes of my early boyhood but a single caboose and all sixteen of us never
 until the summer of 1906 had i had no sanitary conveniences of any the justification or the opportunity for kind
 and very primitive toilet arrngedoing so that justification came in con ments tinued nervous prostration and the i might say
 that i travelled on the means in being permitted to take charge train incognito dressed in a cheap lightof a
 cattle train to montreal a two thou colored summer suit with no item of sand mile ride on a cattle
 train is some clerical attire i saw some life without thing unique for a person to take so the repressive
 influence of clericalism this letter will give some impressions the boys on the whole were good feland some of the
 scenes along the way lows still they would swear awfully at i was warned that the trip would times and
 tell yarns that i could not likely be hard on me but i emerged at repeat i think they will
 forgive me for the other end dirty and very tired but telling this as they were always very with some
 fresh views of life and vigor nice after i revealed my profession ous as a young man of thirty the
 dis a little event with the yardmaster comforts are not worthwhile speaking of i need not repeat but i must
 say the true we had no palatial dining cars sanctifying influences of the minister nor luxurious sleeping cars indeed were
 very evident in his case let me 5 say here that as the herald related it nipeg between regina where
 i lost my the story was erroneous in several par train and broadview i lost my 12 00 ticulars the
 main outline was correct raincoat you may judge how much good how yarns do change as they pass from the
 trip did me when i tell you that mouth to mouth in my return railroad trip i not only at
 schreiber a divisional point in the lost nothing but picked up a good many wilderness north of lake superior i
 had articles that i had no right to the law a terrible fright we arrived in the of compensation works
 out in many village about one o clock in the morn ways ing the night was inky black and a
 i was greatly pleased with the way drizzling rain was falling here and the c p r rushed through these
 cattle there a few lights were to be seen the trains they travel for freight at great cattlemen and railway
 hands had work speed and lose no time at divisional to do thanks to my kind and thought points i
 think we changed cabooses ful friend who got me the trip i was sixteen times and each time they seldom
 the gentleman of the party having no stopped morethan fifteen minutes bework to do don t take me seriously tween
 our arrival and departure it was there were other gentlemen along a dangerous to get off for any reason whatman
 may do hard work and dress in soever we left macleod on a tuesday rough clothing and yet be a
 gentleman evening july the 17 th and arrived in but to resume with heavy grips no montreal on wednesday the
 25 th guide and knowledge of the place i i believe on my arrival at the stockfound what seemed to
 be a hotel cattle yards i must have been the dirtiest looktrains are not met by hotel buses ing person
 who ever arrived in the city or porters going into the building not my most intimate friends would not have
 a soul could be found downstairs and recognized me bathed clothed clerically venturing upstairs i discovered a double and feeling
 quite respectable again i row of doors on each side of a corridor sought the board of trade building i
 tried each one in succession until i where i was to get my cabin passage found a vacant bed in
 my tread along and further information here i found the passage i succeeded in waking a a ticket for a
 first class passage on the number of people one fierce chap steamship athenia dominion line at shouted what the devil
 do your want eight o clock that evening i went on i said a bed well then he an board
 and got settled down in cabin swered go to hell and find a bed which i found very comfortable indeed
 in the morning i arose and felt in i was greatly amused at my young friend my pocket for my
 pocket book and be who had charge of me who advised hold it was gone being nearly broken me to
 keep mum about coming down down nervously i became quite sick in charge of a cattle train perhaps he over
 the loss and could not eat break said some of the swells will think fast a thought struck me that
 it might less of you if you let this out i thought be in the caboose i had left the
 night of bobbie burns poem a man s a man before so to the caboose i went there for a
 that it was in plain view on the floor the from the discomforts and hustle of boys saw it and
 agreed to leave it un a cattle train to the luxury and quiet touched until they would see if the
 of ci first class cabin of a great modern owner came for it after that i ate a iron steamer
 was indeed a great change hearty breakfast the athenia of the donaldson line my friends will be surprised to know
 is one of a fleet of fourteen liners crossthat i had had a series of losses previ ing the atlantic
 between montreal and ously to this in raymond i had forgotten glasgow and registered at 10 150 tons my laundry
 at lethbridge i forgot to fitted up for passengers and freight i buy my half fare ticket at maclead i
 was greatly impressed by its size and left my umbrella in the train and also also by the fact that
 it was built of steel left at the station a three dollar lunch ribs sides decks and masts it had
 on basket i had brought to carry me to win board 1 050 cattle in pens fore and aft mond
 there were several physicians seeking health aboard but no lawyers for which some were devotedly thank ful not even a
 professional politician there were two or three literary people a prominent sunday school worker from hamilton who was full of
 all manner of pranks i had for my vis a vis a female newspaper correspondent a globe trot ter after
 a few vain efforts to air my knowledge i soon subsided into patient silence with an occasional spasmodic effort to
 break my chains on the whole k our table was fortunate in having so experienced and interesting a conversationalist as
 one of its members it is quite remarkable how soon a company of entire strangers will become sociable and friendly
 when cribbed to gether for ten or twelve days doubtless this is greatly due to the fact that all meet
 for at least four meals a day each s person is supposed to at least look pleasant and to contribute
 his or her share j to the pleasantness of the meal stories and laughter are the common features of the
 saloon meal rev charles mckillop the captain as the host is genial and in the lower decks but passengers and
 overflowing with small wit and on the upper decks would scarcely know yarns five meals per day were served that
 cattle were on board these cattle on the athenia abundance of fish sole were fed watered and kept clean in
 the the favorite fowl of all kinds and in most systematic and perfect manner as every style of modern cookery
 suba rule only a very insignificant percent stantial beef and mutton all kinds of age is lost on the passage
 the men who sweetmeat pies and cakes all well look after the cattle are mostly of the cooked and well
 served how the ocean tramp class who get their trip and board traveller is not a dyspeptic for life is
 free for the work they do there were a marvel my advice to any intending some students from winnipeg who
 took travellers who read these words eat this way of getting over the water only three ordinary meals a day
 then cheaply very lightly two meals would be even these steamers are fitted for one better but it requires a
 person with a class only of saloon passengers called strong mind to refrain from following medium saloon so that all
 passengers a multitude to do evil especially on have identical treatment privileges and board ship where there are so few
 ocservice the accommodation is all amid cupations to fill in time ship for those who cared to walk much the

 ottawa he was attention was charles george horetzky cosmopolitan and intelligent but had who had come to ottawa from moose
 fac little to recommend him in the way of tory with his wife mary and their daugh skills or education
 he was widely read ter two years earlier and was a guest in particularly in mathematics yet he felt the

 work scottish by birth he had once spent a with others short time in an aberdeen preparatory shortly after arriving
 in ottawa school for future roman catholic priests horetzky approached sir charles tup but he was an adventurer by nature
 and per who was a friend of his parents in 1854 he travelled to australia in seeking a job on
 numerous occasions order to be a gold seeker he had little tupper requested sandford fleming to success however and consequently
 re hire horetzky but fleming remained unturned to scotland entered the service impressed by horetzky who had no exof the
 hudson s bay company and in perience as a surveyor or as an explorer 1858 was sent as a clerk

 responsible for the unjust suppression deleted because of insufficient data or of his report when horetzky arrived in because they
 were wrong in a note of victoria in may smith asked him to explanation to fleming smith said go on
 a trip up the homathco river to you will have to explain this the reason photograph it thoroughly before leaving

 this job on the homathco was to be and publish that his genius is being repressed if he has not

 which and asked him why he had abandoned he felt should be spent in surveying the party and disobeyed instructions
 the country he had been sent to explore horetzky immediately flew into a rage the truth was that while he
 liked photo and informed smith he did not care a graphy he resisted strenuously any at damn for his instructions

 was more report was unacceptable to him and he than one man could accomplish in four called on fleming who
 also favoured the months he carried on his examinations yellowhead when the report was for three months and then returned
 to printed fleming omitted a map made ottawa probably late in october by smith when smith protested flem in the
 few months after his arrival ing refused to include it thereafter back in ottawa he talked to cambie fleming gave
 instructions to his sur and maclead and found that they spoke veyors directly without going through very highly of the
 pine river pass hor smith as had been done previously in etzky s first reaction was one of elation june
 fleming left for england again after seven years his prognostications without consulting smith about the sea about the pass and
 the surrounding son s work fleming left him no instruc country were being confirmed revelling tions in spite of the
 fact that smith was acting chief fleming letter to secretary of state 8 in 1877 78 joseph hunter explored ‘

 fort garry was photographed by horetzky in 1871 the cariolle and dogs were the favorite means of travelling the winter
 trails 21 in this vindication of his views he wrote obviously best since the route would a letter to alexander
 mackenzie crowing pass through fertile country where snowdelightedly fall was much lighter than in the south mr cambie quite agrees
 with me in and most important the passes were far everything i have ever written regarding lower than the yellowhead
 and the conthe engineering features of the country struction easier the only real issue was he found the pine pass
 an excellent one it is very gratifying to me to find that which of the two northern passes should all
 i ever wrote in that little book dedi be used horetzky s answer was quick cated to yourself has been
 found true the pine river pass to kitimat inlet was without boasting i have really done the best because though
 higher and most serviceable work for the govt at small cost and if my system of survey had longer that
 the peace river pass route been followed from the beginning hundreds construction would not be as difficult of thousands of
 dollars would have been or expensive all of his statements were saved you now kmsow that all my state painstakingly
 supported by copious refments have been proved true 1 erences to the most qualified authorities but his happiness soon turned
 to time and again horetzky pointed out anger and in spite of his reliance on that the discovery of the
 northern routes cambie s report to validate his earlier was not new and that he had advocated statements he soon
 attacked cambie s them since 1872 work this began when he learned that horetzky did not fail to level accusathe
 party had cost 5 000 and was in tions at fleming for by this time he horetzky s own opinion
 nothing more had come to regard fleming as his chief than a mere pic nic instead of a thor enemy
 he pointed out the suppressions ough examination of the country through of his earlier reports and then included which he
 passed horetzky said that some correspondence which put fleming cambie rarely strayed off the main in a poor light to
 conclude he quoted trails from henry macleod he learned from a letter of fleming s to tupper that instead of
 going to the summit of dated september 1879 the babine pass himself cambie had sent there can be no doubt
 that the examinaan indian up to measure the height and tions made this year go to show that to mark
 the level on the aneroid with the northern route possesses advantages greater than previously known from what his finger has
 been brought to light i would consider what angered horetzky primarily it unwise at this stage to adopt and begin
 construction on either the burrard inlet though was not the great cost of cam or bute inlet routes bie s
 journey nor even the slipshod way why asked horetzky was this letter the survey was carried out but the fact
 not included in the report of 1879 he that he felt cambie had allowed him hinted that in fact the
 burrard route to do all the work of heavy exploraion had already been decided upon through and then used his
 results on top of this the advice of fleming therefore the cambie was paid 240 a month and report for
 1879 was framed in accord maclead 200 while horetzky received ance with this decision to ratify the only 160 a
 month order in council of july 1878 at the end of april 1880 horetzky feeling that his pamphlet completely left
