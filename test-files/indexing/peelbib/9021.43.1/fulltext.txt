 patient was equate the woman took offence and walked out so the matron was left alone with the patients and
 had to do the cooking in addition to her nursing duties she asked the hospital board to engage a graduate
 nurse but some of the members rejected the idea as it might prove too expensive they might have to pay
 as much as 15 a month even though that was the salary they had been paying for the untrained aide
 mary ellen was asked it she could get along without a woman for night duty but she replied no sick
 patients require as much if not mome close attention at night as in the day in the end the board
 agreed and a graduate nurse florence tyers came fiom brandon hospital for 25 a month after that happiness prevailed and

 exception of one year spent in calgary she remained theie until her retirement in 1919 ‚Äòmany years later she remarked
 about her initial training i felt i knew very little to face the world with but by dint of reading
 and studying and using the powers of observation i gathered up all i could so different from the advantages and
 tuition that nurses enjoy in the present days of training in recognition of hei pioneering efforts mary ellen birtles was
 awarded the order of the british empire in 1935 and was made a charter member of the manitoba association of

 university of manitoba and taught in manitoba ontario and in england upon his retirement from full time teaching in 1985
 he has devoted much of his time to writing nalberta history winter 1995 manning against medicare by manning his party
 and the era in which he lived cam traynor to understand manning s position the background of medicare is essential
 the 1965 proposal culminated a long on september 8 th 1965 the premier of process of innovation in canadian alberta
 appeared on national television health insurance which had started in voicing his opposition to the federal 1919 when the federal
 liberal party government s medicare pronosal placed national health insurance in its calling for all canadians to oppose the platform
 this was a significant first new policy ernest manning declared it to be socialistic and an infringement on step but
 it prompted little action since individual freedom despite this effort the liberals were not in power true manning s speech
 let s look before innovation came at the provincial level we leap had little impact for it was not in
 the 1930 s several provinces broadcast in most of eastern canada launched government sponsored health the federal government went ahead
 insurance plans but these programs with medicare since it was quite popular floundered under weak finances in and based upon
 years of research 2 1948 the federal government intro above duced grants in aid that helped provin premier ernest c

 saskatchewan medicare had triumphed saskatchewan exploded in heated over the alberta alternative offered a distinct alternative for debate over the
 plan which culminated when the doctors of the province with acting on the commission s report it was not medicare
 drew their services an action that prime minister lester pearson gained international attention a corn announced at the jul y
 1965 promise was finally reached after nearly federal provincial conference his a month but medicare came into effect intention to
 create a medicare plan that anyway making saskatchewan the first would be comprehensive universal province in canada with socialized provincially
 governed and transferable health insurance 4 as a result medicare from province to province 2 this became a hot topic
 in canada with announcement eventually provoked saskatchewan leading the way in radical opposition from several provinces as health care financing
 well as from the medical establishment but despite this resistance the govern manning could not ignore the populari ment introduced
 medicare to parliament ty of medicare alberta did have a in july 1966 with final approval corning health insurance scheme
 but nothing in december the plan came into effect like the saskatchewan model so in on july 1 1968 although

 of social credit had little lasting impact on manning but the general u social ci cdit notion that a conspiracy
 of intem national fmnancius stiove to contiol the woild s money supplies greatly affected him even long after the d

 tainted by the social gospel 5 his theology ‚Äò involved individual salvation without collective or state involvement each person had
 to find their own salvation and had to be free economically and politically to choose to follow christ like many
 other fundamentalists he i viewed humans as essentially alone in a struggle to achieve eternal salvation and believed that a
 collectivist state belittled this struggle and made individuals more classical liberalism came to manning vulnerable to behavior that might lead
 to subtly both through his contact with the eternal damnation consequently business community and through his manning s version of
 social credit had theology some liberalism tended to little to do with monetary reform and contradict social credit ideas but
 everything to do with defending individ manning never abandoned social credit ualism democracy and chm istian prin theory entirely instead

 history winter 1995 u and in sweden where in the fourteen years since their state medicare pro gram began the
 cost has increased by 500 far exceeding official estimates the long range impact on 4 medical standards and the progress
 of medical science is even more serious the fact is there are not enough doctors and medical facilities available to
 make such a program possible without lowering medical standards manning s main since doctors frequently sent him information on the
 decline of british medical care under socialized medicine 28 britain had intro duced medicare in 1946 but the cost had
 become enormous in the 1960 s leaving hospitals overcrowded and understaffed body whether they need the benefits although most britons
 were receivin and whether they wish to be included better health care than before or not it is a compulsory
 program in manning argued that this massive cost which participation is compelled by increase would occur in canada as well
 the state and not left to the voluntary however not all the correspondence he choice of the citizen himself this
 received criticized britain one letter violates a fundamental principle of writer wanted a british medicare system free society namely the
 right of each in canada i am convinced read the citizen to exercise freedom of letter that what is needed
 is a comprechoice 25 hensive contributory medical hospital plan patterned perhaps though not this premise was the foundation of necessarily
 after the one that functions manning s speech the compulsion in satisfactorily on the british islands 3 above medicare was
 simply wrong since apparently manning ignored this praise medical care was a major topic of conver according to the manning
 philosophy and listened to the criticism instead sation in the 1960 s here a medical health forcing everyone to join
 violated the officer checks a child at one of calgary s individual s right to choose but financial cost was
 not all that worhealth clinics in 1962 furthermore health insurance could be ned manning he also feared the human far
 right made affordable for everyone without cost medicare would bring once free premier ernest manning left chats with universality through
 private insurance medical care became a right he argued fellow social credit leaders at the launch and government subsidy for
 the poor 28 people would begin to use medical sering of the 1957 federal election campaign in this way manning
 argued that corn vices more often which would strain with manning are wa c bennett premier pulsion and universality were
 not only existing facilities and reduce health care of british columbia right and solon e wrong but unnecessary quality in
 addition the ever increasing low national leader of the social credit medicare costs would lead to reduced party the premier
 also opposed medicare government research funding and an because of the horrendous cost both eventual decline in medical innovafinancial and
 human that he believed it tion 3 these human costs to manning would bring were simply not worth it the
 projected increases in the cost of related to this cost argument manning state operated medical services are also warned that
 medicare would bring invariably on the low side this has increased taxes existing federal revbeen the experience of both britain
 enue he declared would be inadequate alberta history winter 1995 to cover the huge cost forcing the gov medicare therefore
 went against ernment to increase taxes canadian ideals in one letter concerning medicare he wrote that the same it is
 alarming to hear this plan being objectives can be achieved without advocated as a program to provide destroying the fundamental
 principles of free medical services to the canadian a free society 36 manning was not people a service does not
 become bothered by state involvement in health m d d h m d free simply becausethe government insurance he believed
 the government anning ec are t at e icare pays the bill any bill a government should be involved to
 a limited degree pays it pays with money it takes out would place an intolerable he was concerned that medicare
 of your pockets as the taxpayers of allowed for exclusive government the nation it is misleading to give burden of
 additional taxation on involvement to manning a state the canadian people the false impression that their governments can take monopoly
 was wrong since it stripped the canadian people on additional expenditure without away principles only free enterprise imposing heavy additional
 taxation 32 could supply ironically however manning s own government operated manning never explained why paying liquor and telephone state
 monopolies in for medical services through taxes was alberta 37 the inference was that priworse than paying through insurance vate
 enterprise could supply services premiums the underlying assumption better than the government any health was that taxes were oppressive and
 insurance plan the premier believed should be minimized a belief that should contain some free enterprise thus came out in
 manning s correspondence providing competition and consumer one of his letters declared that medicare choice would place an intolerable burden
 of additional taxation on the canadian peo manning also believed medicare was pie 33 while another concluded socialistic that it
 was the result of medicare would end up saddling the socialist propaganda and would have taxpayers with the crushing burden
 of disastrous hidden consequences additional taxation 34 underlying manning s objection to taxatioii was his belief in free enterprise medical
 insurance could be provided by private companies he argued without resorting to the use of government the premier declared that
 if the federal plan came into effect all existing medical insurance programs and companies providing them will he eliminated i
 submit this is unwise and unwarranted why should such programs be scrapped to give government bureaucracy a monopoly position in
 the field of medical insurance at public expense ski this again is a flagrant violation of the basic principles of
 a free enterprise society 35 manning believed that canada vas grounded on free enterprise amid alberta history winter 1995 the
 federal governmenti has been upon could not be restrained and convinced by socialistic advisers would eventually lead to a socialistic
 that such a plan is what the canadian state program 4 people need and want thei e was a clear
 path opening up for the insidious barrage of socialistic canada manning believed which began propaganda to which society has with
 medicare and led to a welfare state been subjected in recent years has socialism communism and finally totaldulled public concern

 these principles paranoid his ardent anti socialism were remarkably similar to manning s c red rr flowed from the era

 but 1965 speech speculation already started was limited by provincial powers yet the federal government was able to affect alberta
 in ways that went against manning s ideology it was time to move into national politics to bring his philosophy
 to all of canada since the national social credit party had become ineffective and there was little unity among the
 provincial social credit parties manning became the leading defender of conservative values in canada 55 in 1965 he labeled all
 federal politicians ‚Äò opportunists only doing what was popular instead of what was sound ironically manning believed in the democratic
 principle that government officials should give the people what they want even if these were in violation of their personal
 beliefs the calgary herald christened manning the alberta history winter 1995 to appear that he would resign as premier doctrines

 introduced free medical waters with his medicare speech in treatment for certain diseases like cancer anticipation of an entrance into

 gossip but as the specula ers that included free health care tion heightened in 1967 he ended it by ironically

 not oblivious to this inconsistency to stay in power he knew he had to give albertans what they wanted and
 in the post war era they were demanding increased government to prevent another depression 74 behind the manning philosophy it
 seems there was a certain pragmatism of course the premier was not a mere political opportunist doing what was popular
 just to stay in power his administration emanated ideology at all times 7 he even defended his pragmatism with democratic
