 2 00 a year the last great roundup by katherine hughes editor s note this article was written in the
 spring after the disastrous winter of 1906 7 blizzards northern winds and long periods of frigid weather put many small
 ranchers out of business and severely crippled the larger ones in the spring thousands of rotting carcasses were found piled
 up against the fences of the new homesteaders in the coulees and on the prairies katherine hughes author of 1
 atlter laco nbe the black robe voyageur visited the lethbridge area during the roundup of the surviving herds these observations
 were published in the edmonton bulletin june 22 nd 1907 and reprinted in the southern alberta news lethbridge five days

 that is one of many years has southern alberta wit lelhbridge s social charms nessed such a concentration of the
 cattlemen s forces and to all those who have now however the ranch is passing rejoiced in ranching as a
 distinct verile a few months ago the noted cochrane and picturesque phase of western life ranch was disposed of to

 probably be the last gen such numbers that they may be held eral round up in this territory other within

 a storm and district similar movements were put on cut them off from reaching a good feed foot both territory
 and herds are ing ground the settlers barb wire smaller in these districts however but fence is driving out the
 rancher the northern men along the big bow are looking hopefully forward to the close so the owners of the
 circle ranch of the round up by the southern men will curtail their herds and become nes satisfied that a
 large number of their tens as they say in cowboy parlance cattle will have been driven up from the mere
 fact trumpets matter for thought points close to the border to the initiated it marks the beginning of the end

 vast range admirably fitted for but when settlement grew and some stock raising and many american cattle ranchers came to
 hold their herds under men looking for a desirable location fences and by line riders this annual came up across
 the borders they found assembly of ranching forces lost little an invigorating climate warmed by the by little its imposing
 nature each year chinook throughout the short winter however beef round ups of various sizes months a land blessed with
 an abund took place and every spring as before ance of clear water nutritious grasses the cowboys started out in
 groups to which cured on the stem and left food gather the calves brand them and throw for cattle throughout
 the entire winter back on their proper range any cattle which might have drifted away in the the neighbouring indian
 tribes of winter storms blackfoot bloods and peigans controlled by the missionaries and mounted in the midst of albertan winters
 it police gave no trouble as the indians is expected that in occasional wind of the western states did so
 with these storms blowing from various points the several advantages alberta was right cattle will drift to some extent off
 their fully deemed an arcadian cattle country range but during the past winter the succession of storms coming always from
 ranchers and cowboys came in then the north and north east carried the in increasing numbers their cattle majority of
 the cattle far off their range ranged the country from the rockies even the icy surface of the lakes and
 foothills to b eyond the cypress hills rivers offered rio obstacle to the drifting and the whole territory practically be
 herds for the snow on these gave a longed to them it was current belief footing to the animals in
 these storms and niavely encouraged by the ranch the cattle keep drifting as long as the ems that the country
 was quite unfit wind continues to blow and under exfor cultivation and years rolled on isting conditions a prolonged storm
 agreeably in the pleasant cattle country means undoubtedly that they will sooner with the herds increasing and rancher s or
 later drift into a barb wire fence purse mostly well lined with the sales theme the poor unreasoning creatures of

 here last winter over but the eternal inquisitiveness of 35 000 strayed cattle were at one time the man in
 search of land brought first congregated they had drifted before one settler and then another to the ter continued storms
 from points as far north ritory they found the soil rich and as the red deem district some of these

 until alas for the days of the rancher the smoke one most fre the cowboys who were out all winter
 quently sees rising at a distance on the herding as well as possible through all prairie is more likely to
 be from a steam sorts of weather promptly reported to plow than the bivouac of a group of the cattlemen
 this bunching together of cowboys dazed chilled cattle here where there 4 was food for them for not more than
 twenty four hours riders were then as promptly sent out to separate the cattle and drive them off in bunches
 of two or three thousand to every point in the compass so that they might have a better chance of
 feeding every winter some canadian cattle drift over the border into montana and unless very close to the line are
 not driven over in the spring then detached by their brand as claimed by the canamade over to their owners
 dian inspector and the financial returns this year many more cattle than usual drifted before the north wind into montana
 partaking of uncle sam s hospitality for the season and large returns will probably arrive with the shipping season some
 of the cattle unfortunately drifted into the regions blackened with the fray of the sheep and cattle men and were
 shot by the sheep ranchers the latest report coming from the mounted police post at willow creek tells of the
 slaughter of 150 canadian cattle near wildhorse lake howell harris manager of the circle ranch was well known to southern
 alberta slockmen in many respects the past winter has his experienced crew of cowboys led by baldy buck were prominent
 in the last great roundup undoubtedly been an unusual and critical season for the alberta rancher one in which his
 actual losses have not been two or three thousand head of cattle so great as his realization that the days
 before them from the south the moundof the big ranch and the wide free range up trailed in company from
 the lake to are numbered with them will pass coaldale and then struck out across away some of the most
 interesting and country for lethbmidge the cattle were finest traditions of the early days of the all to be thrown
 back to their own range west north of the belly river but the swollen condition of the river made it
 advisable the first section of territory to be to cross as many as possible by the worked this year is
 known to the cow bridge at town which was directly on boys as their poorest ground it is the line
 of route to fresh operations on sparsely settled with no small towns the southwestern ranges to which they may make
 a hilarious entrance and with few cattle ordinarily before reaching lethbridge the circle and one of the little bow pool
 outfits up the three coulees the chin etzi halted their herds of about 6 000 cattle kom and verdiris the
 outfits worked at the circle ranch and under baldy their way with military precision and buck s supervision drove the
 cattle in thoroughness scouring the country for bunches over the river of the thousands miles on each side to gather
 in the cattle and drive them before them the excel of head crossed only one calf was lence of belknap
 buck s campaign is at drowned another outfit with a less adroit chief lost seven cows and a couple once
 apparent to anyone familiar with the country and its trio of almost parallel of calves in an attempt to crcss
 their herd at a less favorable place so waterways disastrous was the result of crossing two weeks after the start
 six of the the first bunch that the rest of the herd outfits that had separated at coaldale were driven
 to lethbridge and crossed met again at terrill s lake each driving on the bridge 5 but the crossing of
 the herds at circle wound in living dark lines through the ranch was a superb spectable one of gray dusk
 a long line rolling breakthe finest in the round up the river ing forming again plodding down to was running
 high gray and turbulent the level meadows by the river here on either side the green prairie stretched the cattle
 snatched at tufts of juicy grass in beautiful undulations some cow and stood at ease like docile regiments boys sent
 across the river rounded up until again forced forward by the cowa few cattle there and held them close boys
 to the bridge there the steady to the river bank as a guide to the thunder of their hoofs broke
 on the still cattle crossing while other riders cut morning air like the measured tread of out a bunch from
 the big herd on the a vast army south side and drove them to the river these latter stepped in
 with eagerness not all the cattle crossed so easily to drink and finding themselves crowded as this the herd driven
 by the bar u from behind by the mounted cowboys outfit stampeded on the plain above were swept out into
 the current they and in the gray dawn the animals started to swim for the opposite bank pounded about belbowing
 2 200 of them the current carried them downstream checked on every side though with but provision had been made
 for this difficulty by a dozen of agile cowboys by the experienced cattlemen who drove riding around them in about
 an hour them in some distance above the landing they were quiet and driven off to the place b ridge

 their horses against ably the last in history the blindly drifting herd kept turning them again so that between the
 storm s but a general round up of cattle in fury and the knowing skill of the cow an extensive
 territory is one of the most boys the cattle kept moving in a circle elusive things in the world as
 you mound and round until the storm died realize after you have waited a couple out then thanks to the
 cowboys of weeks for a favorable moment to see maneuvers the herd was unscattered it at its best its comings
 and goings and still in its place to cross the bridge are in no way to be wagered upon you
 the following morning may expect the mound up to be in your vicinity only when it has arrived this once
 the cattle were across the river is not blameable considering the fancies lethbridge dear to the heart of the cow

 economists have been discussing the general economic position of public util ities john stuart mill writing at the middle of
 the nineteenth century said when a business of real public importance can only be carried on advantageously upon so large
 a scale as to render the liberty of ‘ competition almost illusory it is an unthrilty dispensation of the public
 resources that ‘ several costly sets of arrangements should be kept up for the purpose of rendering ‘ ‘ the
 community this one service it is much 4 better to treat it at once as a public function ‘ ‘
 ‘ and if it be not such as government itself 4 icould beneficially undertake it should be ‘ made over
 entirely to the company or associ ation which will perform it on the best terms to the public only inevitable
 but unquestionably bene ficial the only possible question is whether there shall be public monopoly regulated by public perhaps with
 this well established economic theory in mind the bell telephone company of canada came into being in toronto j une

 information of such i beg to offer the ‘ ‘ ‘ i 4 following explanation v so far back as
 august 1869 when on ‘ my way up from the red river settle ment now manitoba three days out ‘
 ‘ ‘ i heard from some travellers that small pox was in the missouri and that the indians were dying
 in numbers i immediately wrote to fort garmy for vac hundreds of victims of the smallpox epidemic c i were
 left in their dead lodges on the praines cine matter to be sent to the das 1 atciie this view
 shows the rotting remains of a blood wan without delay in order to vaccinate burial lodge near the belly river
 as soon as possible the vaccine did not reach the saskatchewan until the it was a difficult matter to convince
 end of april 1870 it was distributed at the natives that by keeping away from once and the vaccination commenced
 in the infected and by isolating the may shortly after on my way down patients destroying infected clothing the saskatchewan
 river i hadinter that the spread of the disease might to views with the several indian chiefs i a certain
 extent be stopped many of then warned them that small pox was in them seemed to have an idea that
 there the missouri and not to allow their was no danger and that if they were to young men to
 go off on war excursions catch the small pox they would no matin that direction or towards the black ten
 what precautions were taken and foot country and if the epidemic should were careless in consequence to enbreak out among
 them to scatter as force strict rules of quarantine was one much as possible and not keep in large of
 our greatest difficulties free and camps i am sorry to say that little independent as these people are acattention was
 paid to the latter advice customed from their infancy to do almost as will be observed from the foregoing as
 they like and go wherever they narrative when at norway house last please without hindrance any restraint july i first

 i medicine hat news jan 7 1897 19 the beaver river route by walter h scott the beaver river was
 used for many years in transporting supplies to and from the columbia and posts on the athabasca and lesser slave
 lake it was used first by the traders as far as we know in 1789 and was abandoned as a
 route to the columbia and the lesser slave lake posts in 1825 the route followed was as follows katchewan just
 south of it and he has from eastern canada the canoes went marked a route from this post via the
 north from cumbemland house up to and beaver river to the athabasca at all across frog portage into the churchill
 events he was on the west side of isle of english river system to isle a la a la crosse
 lake in 1786 and 1787 on crosse lake and from there by the bea his map dated 1790 he shows
 the route yen river which runs into that lake to from the beaver river through the lakes lac la biche
 then down the la biche including cold lake as leading to the river the outlet of lac la biche into
 the athabasca river but there is no doubt athabasca river and from there up that when he did go down
 the athabasca river to their destination river he went by the methye portage mackenzie mentions that joseph fro from hudson
 bay the canoes either bisher sent his brother as far as the went by way of lake winnipeg to cum
 beaver river however we do know that berland house and then by way of frog angus shaw of the north
 west corn portage to isle a la crosse or there was pany established a post at moose hill another route
 by the nelson river to lake present moose lake near bonny frog portage to isle a la crosse ville in
 1789 the river arises by several branches in 1790 philip tumor was wintering in alberta and one of these branches
 at isle a la cnosse and in his journal commences a short distance from lac he says oct 8 1790
 in part la biche and is easily reached by a short portage it runs easterly through the beaver river falls
 into this lake it is alberta passing about seven miles south not a very big river but as i understand
 it of cold lake and after running easterly breaks into several branches with lakes at the head of them the
 canadians have for about one hundred miles in sas a settlement in one of them called moose katchewan it turns
 north and runs into hill lake a mr shaw is the master he isle a la crosse lake without measun
 has 4 canoes with him tumor s diary ing curves it runs about one hundred p 358 and again in
 may 16 th 1791 he says mr show and 23 canadians in 5 miles in alberta easterly ninety miles in
 canoes arrived from moose hill lake up saskatchewan and then about seventy the beaver river with 127 packs of furs
 miles north and 9 kegs of castoreum 1 fe informed me he had not 5 packs of wolves in his
 cargo an alternative route was to leave the and indeed i saw he had not his whole trade may be
 said to consist of winter beariver about fifty miles south of isle a la ver skins he traded all his
 goods and cnosse lake and go through a series of could have got many more furs if he had lakes
 waterhen lake lac des isles and goods the indians he traded with are cold lake and then portage again to
 called the swampy ground stone indians the beaver river and so on to lac la in masson we find a
 letter from biche angus shaw to rodenick mckenzie peter pond was as far as we know dated 16 december 1789
 from moose the first white man to arrive at the lake beaver river he probably saw it first on 7
 th october i arrived at the entrance in 1776 for he had a post on the sas of moose river
 and would you believe it dr scott presented this paper at a meeting of the historical society in edmonton on
 decemnl er i 1937 a copy was preserved in the society s files in tile alberta legislative library 20 the
 beaver river was part of the fur trade route to the west until 1825 when it was abandoned in favor
 of a trail from edmonton to fort assiniboine this map shows two main routes another was along the chain of
 lakes to cold lake where a portage was made to beaver river although it was only five leagues it took
 in henry s diary mcgillivmay had me nine days to transport the goods there passed that way from dunvegan and
 are 36 rapids in it with very little water there are other references to it one i brought the goods
 however to a large point on the south east of the lake and interesting one dated november 28 th wrought
 2 3 days felling trees for my house 1809 says but then to our great misfortune we found that there
 was no clay within 5 leagues of two freemen arrived from cold lake on us there was no alternative short
 of re the n side of the beaver river they moving to another and more favourable brought a few furs
 and some of the large situation at the entrance of a small river trout in which the lake abounds one
 on the west side of the lake where i im weighed 35 lbs and was of excellent mediately commenced building
 and had all flavor as good as any in lake superior l nished by the 1 st of november afterwards
 we got plenty of fish secured to the thompson went up the beaver river end of march the country is
 entirely in 1798 to establish a post at lac la composed of mountains small lakes and biche ever since 1807
 thompson had small rivers in which there is the greatest quantities of beavers martens etc the been going up the
 saskatchewan and martens are very fine across the mountains at the head water to the columbia until he was prevented
 he mentions living on tullibee and by the peigans in 1810 and found an macdonald of garth who spent two

 white fish were not the best kind he used for transport to the columbia and said the plains were about
 2 i s days it was probably about this time that the march distant and fort des prairies is goods
 commenced to be transported by about eight days distance to the se the beaver river we know that thompson returned
