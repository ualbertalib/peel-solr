 council unity the doctrine of the council what the students don t know won t hurt them was beautifully illustrated
 in the general student meeting wednesday any attempt to elicit information about the political science club from the council was
 met by the president s dogma cabinet unity we stand or fall together or some such nonsense even the suggestion
 of one student that if the councillors would not give their individual opinions it might be well to hear what
 the council in their unified magnificence thought of the matter was met by the astounding reply that the council hadn
 t yet made up their single mind the political science club issue was the most important question on the whole
 budget and the council hadn t come to any decision why hold a meeting in such a case the council
 could very easily have had a special meeting to decide the matter or they might have had their regular meeting
 which was held wednesday on the previous evening the procedure that was followed raises the question why which only the
 council can answer certainly they had no business coming before a student meeting without any definite plan then this principle
 of cabinet unity is simply poppy cock the reasons for its ejystence in parliament don t exist here which the
 president knows full well we submit it was applied only to prevent any embarrassing questions which might be asked concerning
 the political science club and which might lead to other questions being raised about the surplus of last year if
 the meeting had been given a chance to get going it might have developed into something worth while but no
 the council as they always do refused any information and the whole affair petered out granting that as the council
 subsequently passed the political science club budget the matter has ceased to be of any importance yet the principle is
 clear if the council wishes the students to interest themselves in student self government they must change their benign policy
 of repressing information and do all in their power to foster discussion they should realize the students union is something
 which will last as long as western civilization lasts and they must consider the long term significance of their actions
 and pay less attention to their own personal positions
