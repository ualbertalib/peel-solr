 the egg 4 i rim 1 it has so often been said that the arts have always reflected society shakespeare
 drew the court intriguesthe coarse wit and boorishness of the peasant class and all the comedies and tragedies of the
 eliza bethan era then came milton a resonant echo of the puritan in the dark beauty and dignity of his
 verse with charles came romance again in richard lovelace and his kind and in the beauty of sir anthony van
 dyck s portraits and paintings in purcell s spontaneous music following on this is the trim balance of pope and
 dry den and its glorified musical counterpart in bach that mirrored a saner more normal people and so it is
 possible to come up the ages reading and hearing and seeing the life of our ancestors without looking at a
 history book but it rouses the age old question when we consider our own time which comes first the hen
 or the egg does noel coward portray us or do we portray noel coward modern literature music and art 1
 are so widely diffused that they become part of our very selves and we find it increasingly difficult to isolate
 them to say we had the intensity and frenzy of the raphsody in blue until it played itself into our
 emotions and we became intense and frenzied so the older generation says quite mad did we bother our heads about
 four dimensional art until aldous huxley and some of his equally intellectual contemporaries repeatedly i brought the question to our
 notice are we quite as perverted as epstein would have us believe a distorted mirror has been held up to
 us and the finger of art has pointed to our absurd reflection with great mocking so accustomed have we become
 to this state of affairs that our image no longer seems absurd and we have closed our ears to the
 mockerv looking back on the pre raphaelites we see that they too created their own moods and ideals to say
 that it was an aesthetic society at that time would be only partially correct but history will blur the boundaries
 and a hundred years hence the latter part of the nine teenth century will be epitomized by the effeminacy of
 rossetti the detailed symbolism of madox brown and holman hunt and the senti mentalism of franz schubert so in the
 future judging by what modern work is likely to live we will be seen in an age of mental and
 emotional chaosof exquisite but decadent literature of powerful but discordant music of unin telligible but beautiful art whereas we are
 a very average people reading a great many books with happy endings which though they won t be immortal are
 very readable now listening to pretty music that is a creditable echo of the classic composers looking at pictures and
 architecture that is comfortable because it is not provocative but rather than let history down we pose as being intellectual
 perverts
