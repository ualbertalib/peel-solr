 the alberta law quarterly review the first official faculty publication is to make its appearance in the university within a
 week it almost goes without saying that this ambitious project was born and nurtured in the fertile brains in the
 law library it is to be entitled the alberta law quarterly and is a student publication only in that the
 students edit and compile the material and are encouraged to submit contributions it is the aim of the law club
 that the book shall be of interest and assistance to lawyers all over western canada and it is from them
 that the bulk of contributions will be solicited the university of alberta will be the first university in canada to
 actively enter the field of legal publications it is to be hoped that the law school will benefit materially and
 directly as a result of the service they are rendering and that the university as a whole will reap the
 profit of their enthusiasm much can be done in this way by the students to raise the standard of their
 own schools and thus the value of their degrees and the service of the university to the province that supports
 it this is an ambitious project and deserves not only the support of every student in the faculty of law
 but the active interest of the university authorities
