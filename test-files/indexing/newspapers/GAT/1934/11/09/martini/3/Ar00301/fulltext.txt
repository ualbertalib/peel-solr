 impressions of montreal by pat partou the heart of a city of commerce throbbed before me montreal the city of
 contrasts the dual city of canada o what symbols of history and tradition can be hidden in the by paths
 of human experience here we can see two races two creeds two languages two spirits moving onward in peace here
 let us also see a sadder duality accumulated wealth and accumulated poverty i wandered through the narrow streets of old
 montreal i saw a little europe transplanted the language was french the people poor i left the old behind me
 and walked westward as far as westmount such a contrast a scene of the new world unfolded the language was
 english the people rich for many hours i followed aimlessly the winding roads through the best residential districtfinally pausing at
 the top of the mountain where the best view of the city could be seen from this vantage point i
 viewed the old and the new the rich and the poor alike the next day was sunday again i wandered
 aimlessly i sat down on a bench for a moment to contemplate notre dame which stood before me i saw
 it as a stronghold of virtue love and devotion in a world of sin suddenly a rolls royce drew up
 a proud family dressed in the fineries of this age stepped out to pay its respects to the church the
 chauffeur followed his divine service in the car or did he dream of the forty dollars he would receive at
 the end of the month some time later i was picking my way through the dockyards when i perceived a
 prodigious crowd had gathered on closer survey i noted the roughness of their necks and the lowness of their brows
 and marvelled at their soup consuming power then westmount came to my mindand i dreamed about what could be done
 for such men if the world would only face the problem instead of burying itself in side issues having discovered
 a most beautiful church edifice some days earlier i directed myself thither it proved to be a church of england
 and the service was given in its most traditional and ritual formmore so than any other anglican church i have
 attended i have wondered since whether this particular church was hoping to draw membership from the catholic church when i
 discovered what an elite congregation was gathered around mei eyed it as well as i could without making myself conspicuous
 having noted carefully the highness of the brows and the smoothness of the necks and rubbed my own neck to
 ascertain its smoothness i devoted myself to the seriousness of the service the minister dismissed the congregation at ten minutes
 to nine i crossed the busy street and paused for a few minutes in the glare of the colored lights
 of various theatres the last show was about to begin the congestion of traffic hereabouts was the worst i had
 seen it many were the cars that emptied their contents into the theatre entrances the reason seemed to be that
 it was sunday night and it required no careful observer to learn that the people had forgotten the religion of
 their fathers and forsaken the salvation of their souls for other things the people of montreal are in a transition
 stage they seem to have shaken the foundations and traditions upon which has rested the structure of french canadian integrity
 and solidarity a new spirit is born montreal is cosmopolitan and being such it has become more and more like
 the other cities of canada and the united states let us hope that the qualities that have made the french
 canadians such good citizens in the past will be incorporated in the foundations of the new structure that is being
 built
