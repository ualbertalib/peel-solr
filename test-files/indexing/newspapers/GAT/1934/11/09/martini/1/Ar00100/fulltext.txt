 heaving bosom the momentous decision came as the climax to a furious struggle waged in st joe s library wednesday
 evening in which the very souls of councillors were bared in which hearts bled and noses threatened to in which
 clamor and excitement outrivalled in pitch and intensity the best that the new york stock exchange could do during the
 most hectic days of 29 and thus comes to a glorious end the most shocking controversy that has i t
 l ikir l f 1 rt f vt a lnclitu tinn since the famous religious cataclysm o two weeks ago
 richard coeur de lion burns head cd the furious opening charge of th minority forces where is this monej to
 go he roared five dollars o it is to go to janitor s fees yoi should be able to get
 the janitors tc do the speaking for this astronomica sum herr epstein said that the polilica science club wanted to
 hear politica speakers and that every student in the university was a member of the club and would be entitled
 to heai these men madame swallow said that this wa not the point she didn t seem to know just
 what was the point but was certain that this was not it she fel that students should pay for each
 thing they get council was struck by this evidence of woman wanting to pay we re experimenting this year saic
 mr epstein we want to bring sucl men here as fred henderson duncan marshall and mackenzie king we have lots
 of ideas but we don t emblazon them all over you don t neec to think that we re doormat
 i mear dormant burns moved that the political science club be cast out bag and baggage from council let it
 pay its own way like other campus clubs said burns tuck advised caution this club maj prove of great interest
 he said literary has been neglected more than i 1 deserves already burns said that it was not educational it
 didn t deal with the science of politics he said something aboui science of the times why not subsidize the
 s c m too the honorable collins stirred the s c m is a field the university is supposed to
 stay out of he declared someone observed that the university has succeeded pretty well in this respect so far everyone
 isn t interested in politics asserted borgalhis left eye in fact the only eye left flashing everyone isn t interested
 in athletics retorted tuck bravely taking his life in his hands borgal sat down chancellor bierwagen took the floor he
 said that he had consulted dr wallace on the matterand dr wallace expressed the hope that the political science club
 be not dealt with too summarily the club has value he feels in that it brings speakers here who would
 not otherwise comeand also it permits them perfect freedom in expressing their opinions in political matters whereas they are unable
 to expound party dogmas when guests of the university itself mr burns said that if the club could not prove
 itself worthy of being selfsustaining it didn t merit existence epstein said that on that basis rugby would go out
 of existence here would it or would it not be worth 75 to bring these guys here demanded epstein burns
 said he couldn t see it burns was in a difficult position for casper sat beside him and the two
 were enveloped in an impenetrable cloud of cigar smoke casper will either be a detective or a politician when he
 gets big silting at the conference table with a cigar in his mouth nnd a thumb in his vest he
 materially adds to the traditional dignity of council mr epstein said that the club is the melting pot of political
 thought and shouldn t be let go to pot mr bierwagen ever tactful felt that the club should not be
 brutally cut off from the union but by refraining from financing it it would eventually be starved out of existence
 while council could bury it council should not murder it let it charge fees to its members and admissions to
 its meetings he said with sinister sibilance collins felt that the university mentality wouldn t be able to stand the
 strain of paying to learn about politics miss chapman who spoke from the depths of her nursing experience felt that
 the club as latest offspring of council should be bottle fed for at least a yearafter which time it might
 be able to thrive on husks the wauneita chieftain said ugh and nodded assent don wilson looked embarrassed bierwagen was
 in favor ot leaving the question over till the next meeting epstein said that the question hadn t been discussed
 at the union meeting for fear it would have been turned down the decision of the union meeting wouldn t
 have meant a thing said bierwagen we make the decisions collins snid that there was grave danger that the club
 would prove a great success miss swallow said that its program was too hypothetical collins ran madly for the dictionary
 mclntosh pointed out that burns motion was not in order so tuck moved that the club s budget be submitted
 as passed the ayes had it only two neighs being registered council sat in sympathetic silence while burns struggled to
 master his emotion it is at a time like this that a man needs the love and sympathy of an
 understanding woman said burns brokenly council sat in misty eyed silence broken by a trumpet blast fiom the nose of
 mr bierwagennormally one of the most undemonstrative of men the next subject to come up for consideration was that of
 getting a woman s hockey coach us girls want al wilson said miss swallow blushing furiously epstein was doubtful if
 a coach would be able to solve the problem of getting a women s hockey team so it could score
 unless the coach were permitted to play himself miss swallow also said that the basketball girls wouldn t play unless
 they could have doug mclntyre mr burns wanted to know if doug s chipped collar bone would cut any ice
 miss swallow said that basketball wasn t being played on ice this year mr bierwagen announced that the s c
 m is having a clerance sale of academic gowns and offered new low prices to the students union casper smith
 and carlyle were appointed to try and persuade the s c m to come down to 98 c varsity blazers
