 acc arthur d bierwagen was born on the 23 rd day of april 1908 this unexpected punctuality sparing him the
 ignominy of being born on april fool s day attending school at stettlerhe gained honours in grade ix x and
 xii at the same time being an ardent tuxis supporter a fact which should cause our atheistic educationalists to blush
 with shame moving to calgary he attended the normal schoolwhere he obtained first class honours in practice teaching and second
 place in an oratorical contest a fact which has encouraged him to talk ever since choosing teaching as his vocationhe
 enlightened the adolescent of the province for three or four years till discontented with his lot he turned his attention
 to the plough in 1929 he squandered his hoarded savings and bought a farm the soil being barren he was
 forced to rely on the fertility of his imagination and so entered the university in 1930 taking arts and law
 he managed to get a first class general standing two prizes and a scholarship in his first year that this
 early success was merely a flash in the pan may be seen by the fact that in his second year
 he merely took part in an inter university debate nettled by his failure he proceeded in the following year to
 win the imrie memorial scholarship and a prize in history debated in an imperial debate directed the evergreen and gold
 and was defeated as a candidate for the presidency of the students union which may be intimately connected with the
 weakness of his oratory as compared with the vote getting handshake of the genial mr arnold his opponent completely undaunted
 he again entered the political arena and in 1934 was elected to the supreme office since nobody had the temerity
 to oppose him he has an extreme nostalgia for punctualitybut has never been more than half anhour late for lectures
 frugal by nature his noonday meal consists of one bar of eatmore chocolate his wildest orgy being a five cent
 cigar over a glass of beer a racconteur of no mean merithe holds bull sessions spell bound with stories of
 questionable humour but undoubted antiquity equipped with a hat which is doubtless a relic of his agricultural venture he guides
 the destiny of that inert complacent entity the student body
