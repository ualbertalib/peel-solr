        <field name="content"> political science budget passed motion for removal of club from union is not carried junior prom in december commission appointed to investigate the matter of varsity blazers rejoice or be mad council has clasped the political science club to its heaving bosom the momentous decision came as the climax to a furious struggle waged in st joe s library wednesday evening in which the very souls of councillors were bared in which hearts bled and noses threatened to in which clamor and excitement outrivalled in pitch and intensity the best that the new york stock exchange could do during the most hectic days of 29 and thus comes to a glorious end the most shocking controversy that has i t l ikir l f 1 rt f vt a lnclitu tinn since the famous religious cataclysm o two weeks ago richard coeur de lion burns head cd the furious opening charge of th minority forces where is this monej to go he roared five dollars o it is to go to janitor s fees yoi should be able to get the janitors tc do the speaking for this astronomica sum herr epstein said that the polilica science club wanted to hear politica speakers and that every student in the university was a member of the club and would be entitled to heai these men madame swallow said that this wa not the point she didn t seem to know just what was the point but was certain that this was not it she fel that students should pay for each thing they get council was struck by this evidence of woman wanting to pay we re experimenting this year saic mr epstein we want to bring sucl men here as fred henderson duncan marshall and mackenzie king we have lots of ideas but we don t emblazon them all over you don t neec to think that we re doormat i mear dormant burns moved that the political science club be cast out bag and baggage from council let it pay its own way like other campus clubs said burns tuck advised caution this club maj prove of great interest he said literary has been neglected more than i 1 deserves already burns said that it was not educational it didn t deal with the science of politics he said something aboui science of the times why not subsidize the s c m too the honorable collins stirred the s c m is a field the university is supposed to stay out of he declared someone observed that the university has succeeded pretty well in this respect so far everyone isn t interested in politics asserted borgalhis left eye in fact the only eye left flashing everyone isn t interested in athletics retorted tuck bravely taking his life in his hands borgal sat down chancellor bierwagen took the floor he said that he had consulted dr wallace on the matterand dr wallace expressed the hope that the political science club be not dealt with too summarily the club has value he feels in that it brings speakers here who would not otherwise comeand also it permits them perfect freedom in expressing their opinions in political matters whereas they are unable to expound party dogmas when guests of the university itself mr burns said that if the club could not prove itself worthy of being selfsustaining it didn t merit existence epstein said that on that basis rugby would go out of existence here would it or would it not be worth 75 to bring these guys here demanded epstein burns said he couldn t see it burns was in a difficult position for casper sat beside him and the two were enveloped in an impenetrable cloud of cigar smoke casper will either be a detective or a politician when he gets big silting at the conference table with a cigar in his mouth nnd a thumb in his vest he materially adds to the traditional dignity of council mr epstein said that the club is the melting pot of political thought and shouldn t be let go to pot mr bierwagen ever tactful felt that the club should not be brutally cut off from the union but by refraining from financing it it would eventually be starved out of existence while council could bury it council should not murder it let it charge fees to its members and admissions to its meetings he said with sinister sibilance collins felt that the university mentality wouldn t be able to stand the strain of paying to learn about politics miss chapman who spoke from the depths of her nursing experience felt that the club as latest offspring of council should be bottle fed for at least a yearafter which time it might be able to thrive on husks the wauneita chieftain said ugh and nodded assent don wilson looked embarrassed bierwagen was in favor ot leaving the question over till the next meeting epstein said that the question hadn t been discussed at the union meeting for fear it would have been turned down the decision of the union meeting wouldn t have meant a thing said bierwagen we make the decisions collins snid that there was grave danger that the club would prove a great success miss swallow said that its program was too hypothetical collins ran madly for the dictionary mclntosh pointed out that burns motion was not in order so tuck moved that the club s budget be submitted as passed the ayes had it only two neighs being registered council sat in sympathetic silence while burns struggled to master his emotion it is at a time like this that a man needs the love and sympathy of an understanding woman said burns brokenly council sat in misty eyed silence broken by a trumpet blast fiom the nose of mr bierwagennormally one of the most undemonstrative of men the next subject to come up for consideration was that of getting a woman s hockey coach us girls want al wilson said miss swallow blushing furiously epstein was doubtful if a coach would be able to solve the problem of getting a women s hockey team so it could score unless the coach were permitted to play himself miss swallow also said that the basketball girls wouldn t play unless they could have doug mclntyre mr burns wanted to know if doug s chipped collar bone would cut any ice miss swallow said that basketball wasn t being played on ice this year mr bierwagen announced that the s c m is having a clerance sale of academic gowns and offered new low prices to the students union casper smith and carlyle were appointed to try and persuade the s c m to come down to 98 c varsity blazers came up the pubicity department urges them so coun il would have to do something about t casper deprecated the color

        <field name="content"> the alberta law quarterly review the first official faculty publication is to make its appearance in the university within a week it almost goes without saying that this ambitious project was born and nurtured in the fertile brains in the law library it is to be entitled the alberta law quarterly and is a student publication only in that the students edit and compile the material and are encouraged to submit contributions it is the aim of the law club that the book shall be of interest and assistance to lawyers all over western canada and it is from them that the bulk of contributions will be solicited the university of alberta will be the first university in canada to actively enter the field of legal publications it is to be hoped that the law school will benefit materially and directly as a result of the service they are rendering and that the university as a whole will reap the profit of their enthusiasm much can be done in this way by the students to raise the standard of their own schools and thus the value of their degrees and the service of the university to the province that supports it this is an ambitious project and deserves not only the support of every student in the faculty of law but the active interest of the university authorities</field>

        <field name="content"> impressions of montreal by pat partou the heart of a city of commerce throbbed before me montreal the city of contrasts the dual city of canada o what symbols of history and tradition can be hidden in the by paths of human experience here we can see two races two creeds two languages two spirits moving onward in peace here let us also see a sadder duality accumulated wealth and accumulated poverty i wandered through the narrow streets of old montreal i saw a little europe transplanted the language was french the people poor i left the old behind me and walked westward as far as westmount such a contrast a scene of the new world unfolded the language was english the people rich for many hours i followed aimlessly the winding roads through the best residential districtfinally pausing at the top of the mountain where the best view of the city could be seen from this vantage point i viewed the old and the new the rich and the poor alike the next day was sunday again i wandered aimlessly i sat down on a bench for a moment to contemplate notre dame which stood before me i saw it as a stronghold of virtue love and devotion in a world of sin suddenly a rolls royce drew up a proud family dressed in the fineries of this age stepped out to pay its respects to the church the chauffeur followed his divine service in the car or did he dream of the forty dollars he would receive at the end of the month some time later i was picking my way through the dockyards when i perceived a prodigious crowd had gathered on closer survey i noted the roughness of their necks and the lowness of their brows and marvelled at their soup consuming power then westmount came to my mindand i dreamed about what could be done for such men if the world would only face the problem instead of burying itself in side issues having discovered a most beautiful church edifice some days earlier i directed myself thither it proved to be a church of england and the service was given in its most traditional and ritual formmore so than any other anglican church i have attended i have wondered since whether this particular church was hoping to draw membership from the catholic church when i discovered what an elite congregation was gathered around mei eyed it as well as i could without making myself conspicuous having noted carefully the highness of the brows and the smoothness of the necks and rubbed my own neck to ascertain its smoothness i devoted myself to the seriousness of the service the minister dismissed the congregation at ten minutes to nine i crossed the busy street and paused for a few minutes in the glare of the colored lights of various theatres the last show was about to begin the congestion of traffic hereabouts was the worst i had seen it many were the cars that emptied their contents into the theatre entrances the reason seemed to be that it was sunday night and it required no careful observer to learn that the people had forgotten the religion of their fathers and forsaken the salvation of their souls for other things the people of montreal are in a transition stage they seem to have shaken the foundations and traditions upon which has rested the structure of french canadian integrity and solidarity a new spirit is born montreal is cosmopolitan and being such it has become more and more like the other cities of canada and the united states let us hope that the qualities that have made the french canadians such good citizens in the past will be incorporated in the foundations of the new structure that is being built</field>

        <field name="content"> acc arthur d bierwagen was born on the 23 rd day of april 1908 this unexpected punctuality sparing him the ignominy of being born on april fool s day attending school at stettlerhe gained honours in grade ix x and xii at the same time being an ardent tuxis supporter a fact which should cause our atheistic educationalists to blush with shame moving to calgary he attended the normal schoolwhere he obtained first class honours in practice teaching and second place in an oratorical contest a fact which has encouraged him to talk ever since choosing teaching as his vocationhe enlightened the adolescent of the province for three or four years till discontented with his lot he turned his attention to the plough in 1929 he squandered his hoarded savings and bought a farm the soil being barren he was forced to rely on the fertility of his imagination and so entered the university in 1930 taking arts and law he managed to get a first class general standing two prizes and a scholarship in his first year that this early success was merely a flash in the pan may be seen by the fact that in his second year he merely took part in an inter university debate nettled by his failure he proceeded in the following year to win the imrie memorial scholarship and a prize in history debated in an imperial debate directed the evergreen and gold and was defeated as a candidate for the presidency of the students union which may be intimately connected with the weakness of his oratory as compared with the vote getting handshake of the genial mr arnold his opponent completely undaunted he again entered the political arena and in 1934 was elected to the supreme office since nobody had the temerity to oppose him he has an extreme nostalgia for punctualitybut has never been more than half anhour late for lectures frugal by nature his noonday meal consists of one bar of eatmore chocolate his wildest orgy being a five cent cigar over a glass of beer a racconteur of no mean merithe holds bull sessions spell bound with stories of questionable humour but undoubted antiquity equipped with a hat which is doubtless a relic of his agricultural venture he guides the destiny of that inert complacent entity the student body</field>

        <field name="content"> exc usif à 0:a la liberté 0:liberte et le patriote par jacquet lemoyne quels sentiments animent les nageurs de longue distance est ce 0:est 0:ce le désir 0:desir de s enrichir le goût 0:gout pour l exhibitionisme la soif de l aventure ou le simple besoin de se prouver qu ils ne manquent 0:man 0:quent ni de courage ni d endurance 0:d 0:endu 0:rance voila autant de questions que nous nous posons chaque fois que nous entendons parler des exploits et des déceptions 0:deceptions de ces curieuses personnes qui luttent jusqu à 0:a 1 épuisement 0:epuisement contre 0:con 0:tre des éléments 0:elements que 1 homme a dompté 0:dompte depuis longtemps grâce 0:grace à 0:a la navigation mlle shirley campbell qui retournera probablement dans les eaux du lac ontario l an prochain dans l espoir d atteindre 0:d 0:attein 0:dre son objectif qui est de traverser 0:tra 0:verser cette froide masse d eau a affirme qu elle n avait pas entrepris 0:en 0:trepris cette lutte dans un but lucratif mais simplement par esprit sportif pour réaliser 0:realiser une ambition qu elle caresse depuis l exploit de marllyn bell quand on lui a demandé 0:demande à 0:a quoi elle pensait en nageant pendant de si longues heures elle a admis ou presque qu elle songeait principalement au moment ou elle atteindrait le but à 0:a la satisfaction 0:sa 0:tisfaction qui suivrait d avoir atteint son objectif dans le cas de cette nageuse il semblerait que la lutte se livre principalement 0:principale 0:ment en elle et que tant que son esprit obéit 0:obeit aux ordres de ses muscles elle peut avancer jusqu au but mais pour tous les autres qui s épuisent 0:epuisent ainsi en des marathons 0:mara 0:thons parfois inutiles peut on nier qu u n y au pas cnez eux un fort goût 0:gout pour 1 exhibitionis me 0:exhibitionis 0:me et un très 0:tres grand désir 0:desir d atteindre 0:d 0:at 0:teindre avec 1 autre rive une renommée 0:renommee monayable et si on s arrête 0:arrete un instant pour songer a ce que nous faisons tous dans la vie ne trouvez vous pas que nous ressemblons étrangement 0:etrangement a ces nageurs et nageuses à 0:a certains 0:cer 0:tains jours cédule 0:cedule mixte le baseball majeur s achemi ne t il vers une cedule mixte nous le croyons et nous sommes 0:som 0:mes partisans de cette idée 0:idee qui n est pas nouvelle mais qui se gagne des adeptes tous les jours jes yankees de new york sont les principaux responsables de cet état 0:etat d esprit et leurs succès 0:succes répétés 0:repetes amènent 0:amenent leurs adversaires 0:adversai 0:res a imaginer toutes sortes de moyens pour rendre la lutte plus chaude dans l américaine 0:americaine on affirme en effet que si les yankees 0:yan 0:kees avaient a faire face à 0:a des équipes 0:equipes comme celles de mll waukee 0:mll 0:waukee cincinnati et brooklyn ils ne pourraient remporter des séries 0:series de victoires consécutives 0:consecutives aussi nombreuses et aussi décourageantes 0:decourageantes 0:décou 0:decou 0:rageantes pour leurs adversai res il y a certainement quelque 0:quel 0:que chose de vrai dans tout cela 0:ce 0:la mais il ne faut pas oublier que les yankees joueraient contre 0:con 0:tre les cubs les gjants et les pirates et pourraient remporter des victoires faciles dans la majorité 0:majorite 0:ma 0:jorité 0:jorite des cas contre ces équipes 0:equipes 0:équi 0:equi 0:pes si la cedule mixte ne parvenait 0:parve 0:nait pas a ralentir la marche des yankees elle rendrait la lutte 0:lut 0:te certainement plus chaude et plus intéressante 0:interessante dans les deux ligues les clubs pourraient jouer le même 0:meme nombre de joutes 0:jou 0:tes mais au lieu de se rencontrer 0:rencon 0:trer aussi souvent visiteraient et seraient visites en retour par dea équipes 0:equipes nouvelles toutes ces nouveautés 0:nouveautes attireraient un plus grand nombre de spectateurs 0:specta 0:teurs aux joutes dans toute les villes mêmes 0:memes les plus faibles une joute entre washington et les cubs de chicago ne serait peut être 0:etre pas intéressante 0:interessante pour les amateurs de baseball de autres 0:au 0:tres villes mais justement a cause de l égalité 0:egalite des forces en présence 0:presence les amateurs de chicago 0:chica 0:go et de washington ne voudraient 0:vou 0:draient pas perdre cette occasion 0:occa 0:sion de voir leurs favoris l emporter 0:l 0:em 0:porter au moins une fou une ligue cette cédule 0:cedule mixte entraînerait 0:entrainerait 0:entraîne 0:entraine 0:rait la disparition d une des deux grandes ligues majeures affirmeront les adversaires du projet rjous ne voyons pas pour quoi on pourrait garder le même 0:meme 0:mê 0:me 0:me système 0:systeme de deux ligues en comptant les moyennes comme on le fait aujourd hui les meneur 0:me 0:neur dans chaque circuit n au raient pas la tâche 0:tache aussi facile car 11 ne leur serait pas suffisant 0:suffi 0:sant de vaincre un ou deux autres 0:au 0:tres club pour maintenir leur avance 11 leur faudrait vaincre quatre cinq et même 0:meme six autres 0:au 0:tres clubs bien souvent pour conserver le premier rang dans leur ligue c est ainsi que si les yankees éprouvaient 0:eprouvaient de la difficulté 0:difficulte 0:dif 0:ficulté 0:ficulte avec les lanceurs de la nationale et les whlte sox en éprouvaient 0:eprouvaient moins la lutte dans l américaine 0:americaine serait plus contestée 0:contestee 0:contes 0:tée 0:tee du fait que l opposition présenterait 0:presenterait 0:pré 0:pre 0:senterait des forces nouvelles plus régulièrement 0:regulierement a l heure actuelle les yankees 0:yan 0:kees ont un avantage très 0:tres marqué 0:marque 0:mar 0:qué 0:que sur la majorité 0:majorite de leurs adversaires 0:ad 0:versaires dès 0:des qu ils sautent sur le terrain de jeu les autres clubs sont habitues à 0:a se faire battre par les champions de l américaine 0:americaine 0:l 0:a 0:méricaine 0:mericaine et leur jeu se ressent de ce sentiment d infériorité 0:inferiorite plus les yankees jouent contre ces clubs plus facile devient leur tâche 0:tache mais qu on ecourte ces visites et les clubs perdront peut être 0:etre cette crainte des cham pions 0:cham 0:pions qu ils verront moins souvent 0:sou 0:vent et contre lesquels ils auront 0:au 0:ront peut être 0:etre alors plus de chances de résister 0:resister pour notre part des séries 0:series yankees braves ou encore cleveland brooklyn seraient des plus passionnantes et stimuleraient davantage l enthousiasme 0:l 0:en 0:thousiasme des millions de personnes 0:per 0:sonnes pour lesquelles le baseball 0:base 0:ball est devenu le sport le plus intéressant 0:interessant au monde quelle histoire on se souvient que lorsqu il a été 0:ete question d organiser la rencontre 0:ren 0:contre moore parker les promoteurs 0:promo 0:teurs de l ibc ont immédiatement 0:immediatement 0:immédiate 0:immediate 0:ment annonce que les mains de floyd paterson étaient 0:etaient en parfait 0:par 0:fait état 0:etat et qu dl serait prêt 0:pret à 0:a défendre 0:defendre son honneur contre moore en septembre si ce dernier 0:der 0:nier gagnait contre parker on volt aujourdhul qu il ne s agissait 0:s 0:agis 0:sait la que d une vulgaire manoeuvre 0:ma 0:noeuvre pour alarmer moore et endormir le public maintenant que moore a disposé 0:dispose de parker avec une facilite déconcertante 0:deconcertante les mains de paterson guéries 0:gueries il y a trois semaines sont en si mauvais état 0:etat qu il ne pourra faire face à 0:a moore en septembre 0:septem 0:bre en d autres mots l ibc réalisant 0:realisant que paterson n est pas prêt 0:pret a affronter moore va retarder 0:retar 0:der ce match jusqu au jour ou moore trop vieux pour se battre 0:bat 0:tre encore sera une proie facile 0:faci 0:le pour le jeune paterson il nous semble donc évident 0:evident que le champion mondial des poids lourds est maintenant ar chle 0:ar 0:chle moore en effet si l aspirant 0:l 0:aspi 0:rant numéro 0:numero un se sauve il ne reste plus aux diverses commissions 0:commis 0:sions athlétiques 0:athletiques qu un seul devoir 0:de 0:voir à 0:a accomplir celui de déclarer 0:declarer 0:décla 0:decla 0:rer moore champion par défaut 0:defaut et de l inviter a défendre 0:defendre son titre 0:ti 0:tre contre des aspirants qui n ont pas les mains aussi faciles 0:faci 0:les a briser l ibc ne veut pas de moore comme champion parce 0:par 0:ce que ce dernier n acceptera pas les petites comb nes de ces messieurs et on a ainsi décidé 0:decide de faire attendre celui qui a déjà 0:deja 0:dé 0:de 0:jà 0:ja attendu 12 ans avant d obtenir 0:d 0:obte 0:nir un match de championnat dans la classe des mi lourds il est temps plus que jamais de souhaiter qu on adopte une législation 0:legislation 0:lé 0:le 0:gislation qui redonnera à 0:a la boxe un semblant d honnêteté 0:honnetete</field>

façon 0:facon encore plus remarquable que dans les années 0:annees précédentes 0:precedentes par la présence 0:presence d une forte delé 0:dele i ration de la province de québec 0:quebec neuf canadiens français 0:francais originaires de ladite province ont en effet pris une part ac ii 0:ac 0:ii tive à 0:a ces assise i leur présence 0:presence a été 0:ete commentée 0:commentee par l un des orateurs i qui a tenu a expliquer pourquoi les partisans québécois 0:quebecois m avaient récemment 0:recemment adopte un autre nom celui de parti so cial démocrate 0:democrate question de traduction

0:montreal préposée 0:preposee durant le congrès 0:congres au service de traduction des documents mme casera in a d ailleurs tiré 0:tire i sente les resolutions du congres parmi lesquelles il y en avait une favorable au bilinguisme canadien la délégation 0:delegation était 0:etait imposante autant par le prestige de ses membres que par leur nombre on y remarquait par exemple m jacques perreault professeur de droit à 0:a l université 0:universite 0:l 0:uni 0:versité 0:versite de montréal 0:montreal et membre de l administration du dev oir m jean ouellette vice président 0:president de la confédération 0:confederation des travailleurs catholiques du canada m alfred payette rédacteur 0:redacteur 0:ré 0:re 0:dacteur en chef de l hebdomadaire la frontière 0:frontiere de rouyn leur participation au congrès 0:congres de winnipeg ainsi que leur activité 0:activite politique dâns 0:dans le québec 0:quebec s expliquent de plusieurs 0:plu 0:sieurs façons 0:facons si l on en juge d après 0:apres les opinions exprimées 0:exprimees par trois délégués 0:delegues au cours d une visite aux bureaux de la libertét 0:libertet le patriote parfois le fervent du psd est tout simplement un t jeune hommo aux idées 0:idees révolutionnaires 0:revolutionnaires fortement influencé 0:influence par un milieu universitaire effervescent et par des profes r 0:profes 0:r seurs convaincus de la nécessité 0:necessite d une réforme 0:reforme sociale au pays cela peut conduire au marxisme mais l effet tempé 0:tempe t 0:tempé 0:tempe 0:t rant d autres convictions soit religieuses soit familiales fait opter pour une formule moins violente celle d un socialisme démocrate 0:democrate un séjour 0:sejour dans les régions 0:regions exploitées 0:exploitees par les compagnies 0:com 0:pagnies minières 0:minieres et autres qui brassent des profits impressionnants 0:impres 0:sionnants peut renforcer ce point de vue m jacques perreault ne s est pas gêné 0:gene du tout pour ex poser le raisonnement qui l a transforme lui fils d avocat en 1 champion de la cause des ouvriers et des cultivateurs ces deux classes du peuple n ont pas leur juste part des béné 0:bene 4 fices de l économie 0:economie soutient il et c est seulement par l union de leurs forces sur le plan politique qu elles peuvent amélio 0:amelio i 0:amélio 0:amelio 0:i rer d une façon 0:facon radicale leurs conditions de vie elles ne peu ivcni rien attendre seion ai rerreauu aes vieux parus d autre part les problèmes 0:problemes agricoles et surtout industriels débordent 0:debordent largement de nos jours les cadres de la vie politique 0:poli 0:tique provinciale pour être 0:etre vraiment efficace il faut donc que l effort de reforme sociale et politique au québec 0:quebec soit dans une certaine mesure lié 0:lie aux efforts analogues d un groupement d envergure nationale l u c c par exemple doit nécessairement 0:necessairement entretenir des relations avec la cana dian 0:cana 0:dian fédération 0:federation of agriculture de même 0:meme dans le domaine politique proprement dit m perreault croit que cela conduit nécessairement 0:necessairement a 1 établissement 0:etablissement d une section québécoise 0:quebecoise de la c c f car c est le seul parti qui n est pas esclave des puissances qui empêchent 0:empechent les cultivateurs et lesf ouvriers d atteindre leurs buts il n ignore pas que cette politique soulève 0:souleve toute la ques tion de la conservation de la mentalité 0:mentalite canadienne française 0:francaise f au québec 0:quebec mais il soutient que l industrialisation vertigi r ncuse de la vieille province impose d une manière 0:maniere inévitable 0:inevitable i une collaboration nationale capable de fusionner les aspira i tions de la classe ouvrière 0:ouvriere et agricole du canada tout entier i j m perreault souligne que le travail d organisation ne fait k que débuter 0:debuter dans sa province i m ouellette explique sa présence 0:presence dans les rangs du tp s d en se plaçant 0:placant au point de vue de l ouvrier il fait res sortir 0:res 0:sortir par exemple que le syndicat local de la c t c c à 0:a arvida ne jouit plus du monopole des ouvriers dans l industrie 0:l 0:indus 0:trie de l aluminium puisqu un syndicat plus puissant existe maintenant à 0:a kitimat c b ce fait se réalise 0:realise de plus en plus en d autres domaines de l industrie naturellement cela porte i les ouvriers du québec 0:quebec a comparer les avantages d une part 1 i d un syndicat national fortement organisé 0:organise et d autre part i d un syndicat provincial plus faible et moins bien servi de personnel compétent 0:competent et de bureaux de recherches on espère 0:espere ti trouver une formule revela t il pour conserver à 0:a la c t c c son autonomie et ses fonctions propres à 0:a l égard 0:egard de ses mem bres sans nuire à 0:a l harmonie syndicale et en laissant au syn t dicat national le droit de parler au nom de tous à 0:a ottawa tout ce programme destiné 0:destine à 0:a sauvegarder et à 0:a faire progres j ser les classes moins favorisées 0:favorisees de la province de québec 0:quebec se réalisera 0:realisera selon m ouellette avec l aide du parti c c f f les trois délégués 0:delegues ont aussi fait remarquer que la par 7 ticlpation québécoise 0:quebecoise produit un autre fruit très 0:tres appréciable 0:appreciable celui de faire connaître 0:connaitre les canadiens français 0:francais sous leur vrai jour et dès 0:des lors de les faire accepteret respecter davantage 1 ils ont exprime l opinion que grâce 0:grace a cette présence 0:presence au sein j du parti et au congrès 0:congres national la position centralisatrice que certains chefs de la c c f ont récemment 0:recemment exprimé 0:exprime à 0:a ottawa 1 ne représente 0:represente plus le point de vue de la maiorité 0:maiorite des mem i i bres ils avaient l impression que les canadiens français 0:francais de f l ouest font face depuis longtemps au problème 0:probleme que pose la i collaboration dans la poursuite d un même 0:meme bien commun avec i leurs concitoyens sans que les collaborateurs perdent leur m propre identité 0:identite cependant pas plus que leurs compatriotes m des prairies ils osent croire que le chemin qu ils se sont tra w ces est exempt de cahots et de détours 0:detours ces hommes réalistes 0:realistes parlent un langage que les cana v diens français 0:francais de l ouest comprennent tout naturellement m spécialement 0:specialement en ce qui regarde les moyens à 0:a prendre pour yf atteindre un but pratique ils ont l air de croire cependant mm ue a p051011 d un nouveau parti de reforme sociale dans 1 la province de québec 0:quebec a l égard 0:egard des vieux partis de cette m i province est nécessairement 0:necessairement identique à 0:a la position du parti i c c f à 0:a ottawa ou à 0:a celle de ce même 0:meme parti dans chacune 1 i des autres provinces les bases d un effort commun sur le 1 i plan national et sur le plan provincial en dehors de la pro 1 1 vince de québec 0:quebec sont peut être 0:etre plus larges et plus variées 0:variees ijj que ces défricheurs 0:defricheurs semblent le réaliser 0:realiser </field>

0:nefastes 0:néfas 0:nefas 0:tes de ce développement 0:developpement extraordinaire 0:extra 0:ordinaire est l inflation causée 0:causee a la fois par la rareté 0:rarete de matériaux 0:materiaux 0:maté

0:che de certains projets d envergure 0:d 0:enver 0:gure dans le domaine de la construction c est dire qu une trop grande prospérité 0:prosperite au canada est la source de problèmes 0:problemes

m l archeveque de st boniface est mort le mardi 15 juin a 9 heures du matin a l hotel dieu de montreal apres une courte crise de maladie la sante du venerable prelat etait deja depuis longtemps chancelante mais on n avaii point perdu 1 vpoir d un parfait retablissement et l on pouvait consteterjun regain de vigueur depuis le sejour que fit le venere malade au texas l hiver dernier pour nous c est l espoir que nous conservions surtout depuis la recente visjte de sa grandeur a prince albert lors de l inauguration de la cathedrale le denouement est d autant plus douloureux qu il est plus inattendu f mgr langevin se rendit a montreal pour affaires importantes il y aune coupile de semaines et la semaine derniere enlettre il assistait aux fetes du jubile sacerdotal de son eroinence le cardinal begin a quebec mais lundi soir il se sentit soudainement tres indispose et son etat devint si critique que mgr bruchesi archeveque de montreal son ami et condisciple fut appele pour lui
